_*Awokola, B. I., Okello, G., Mortimer, K. J., Jewell, C. P., Erhart, A., \& Semple, S. (2023). Measuring air quality for advocacy in Africa (MA3): Feasibility and practicality of longitudinal ambient PM2.5 measurement using low-cost sensors. International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 20(2), 1036. *[https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20021036](*https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20021036*)_

   * **Background**
       * Ambient air pollution is a major public-health problem globally; especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposures linked to respiratory, cardiovascular and other diseases (Awokola, 2020).
       * In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) there is a scarcity of ambient air quality monitoring data, and thus limited evidence of exposure levels.
           * This means that we cannot use the data available to create policies.
       * Low-cost sensor technologies are increasingly available; they may enable wider deployment of monitoring networks in resource-limited settings.
           * Low-cost: $100 - $500
           * These data generated can be used for policy advocacy.
       * Rationale: To evaluate whether low-cost sensors can be practically used in multiple African sites to generate ambient PM2.5 data and support
           * To understand if it is feasible and practical to use low-cost settings in an African setting.
   * **Locations:**
       * 13 locations in total, 7 of which were in Nigeria, and the other 6 were other African countries.
   * **Sensor deployment**
       * Installed in an open area, free from obstructions such as trees and fences.
       * Located away from dust sources like unpaved roads or rooftop air inlets.
       * Positioned at least 100 meters from heavily trafficked or dusty roads.
       * Mounted two meters above the ground for consistency and data comparability.
           * Two meteres above the ground is important because the sensors should detect human breathable air.
           * Also to avoid dust from getting into the sensor.
       * Placed away from non-traffic pollution sources such as generators, incinerators, air vents, and grills.
       * Due to power issues in SSA, the sensors were equipped with power banks
       * Of the 13 sensors, only 2 were able to give actual real time data. The rest of them had their data collated end of day and sent it, due to internet connectivity issues.
   * **Data Recovery Rate**
       * Median data recovery rate across 13 sites: 94% (range 72% to 100%)
       * Only one site failed to collect data due to technical issues.
   * **Challenges:**
       * Real-time clock stability; can cause time drift if the device goes offline
       * Devices can log incorrect times if not connected to the internet.
       * Corrupt firmware (reason for exclusion of Cameroon)
   * **Discussions:**
       * The high data recovery rate of 94% indicates that low-cost sensors can feasibly be deployed and operated in SSA settings for short-term monitoring.
       * One of the biggest challenges experienced across the sites came from power outages due to irregular power supply.
       * Another important practical issue encountered was related to identifying a suitable location, particularly given the need for regular and safe access to the device to remove and re-insert the SD card to acquire stored data.
       * The study supports the concept of using low-cost sensors as a tool to raise public, societal and policymaker awareness about air pollution.
   * **Strengths:**
       * Multi-site across seven countries provides broad geographic representation.
       * High recovery rate and evidence of feasibility in resource-limited settings.
       * Focus on practicality and operational challenges (not just sensor performance) valuable for implementation research
   * **Weaknesses**
       * Deployment at institutional sites may differ from community or highly informal settings; generalizability may be limited
       * Short monitoring duration (~30 days) - limited seasonal/yearly variability assessment.
   * **Conclusions:**
       * The study demonstrates that the deployment of low-cost sensors for ambient PM2.5 monitoring in SSA is both feasible and practical, achieving high data recovery across varied settings.
       * The ambient PM2.5 concentrations measured highlight significant air-pollution burdens in multiple African urban sites
       * These findings support the potential for-scaling low-cost sensor networks to support local evidence generation, advocacy, policy-engagement, and ultimately improved air quality and health
   * **Case Study:**
       * From the year 2022 to 2024, ELHEAS sponsored the use of these sensors to gather Air Pollution data from the city of Douala.
       * Resource: [https://map.purpleair.com/](https://map.purpleair.com/)
           * Shows how many Purple Air apps in Cameroon.
       * Pollution Peaks:
           * High levels of air pollution during the dry seasons
           * Major dry season: January to March
           * Minor dry season: November to December
       * Decrease in PM2.5 Levels:
           * Significant reduction in air pollution during the rainy seasons
           * Minor rainy season: April to June Major rainy season: July to September
