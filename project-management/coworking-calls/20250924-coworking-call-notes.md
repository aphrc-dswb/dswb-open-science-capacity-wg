## Notes

**Journal Club Material:**

Ambati, S. S. K. N. (2025).* Breaking healthcare silos: An AI-driven framework for healthcare data integration.* International Journal of Computer Engineering and Technology, 16(1), 1965â€“1978. [https://doi.org/10.34218/IJCET\_16\_01\_142](https://doi.org/10.34218/IJCET\_16\_01\_142)". 

   * **The current state of healthcare data**
       * The healthcare sector's digital transformation has evolved, with 55% of institutions employ multiple EHR systems with 67% interoperability challenge
       * Improves clinical documentation efficiency by 32%, but integration across platforms remains challenging
       * 73% of organizations are now actively pursuing technological transformation initiatives to overcome these integration challenges and improve data analytics capabilities
       * The evolution of these systems has created a complex ecosystem, healthcare providers must navigate
       * through an average of five d/t UI to access patient information
   * **Legacy systems**
       * Legacy systems: 89% still in use, that predate modern interoperability standards with 78% reporting difficulties in data exchange between old and new
       * Healthcare organizations spend an average of 45 minutes per patient encounter reconciling data across different systems, with accuracy rates varying between 82-94% depending on the type of clinical information being accessed
       * Organizations adopting modern technological tools and analytics platforms can reduce this
       * reconciliation time by up to 40% while improving accuracy rates to 96%
   * **Economic Implication**
       * Organizations dedicate approximately 24% of IT budget to maintain legacy systems and addressing integration challenges
       * Modern integration solutions achieve cost savings of 35% in data management expenses, while those maintaining fragmented systems face escalating maintenance costs averaging 12% annual increases
       * Adoption of modern technological tools and data analytics solutions can further reduce costs by 25-30% through improved operational efficiency and reduced manual interventions
       * The financial impact extends beyond direct IT costs, affecting clinical efficiency and resource utilization across various healthcare
   * **Current interoperability standards**
       * 72% of healthcare organizations adopted standardized data exchange protocols, but only 34% achieve full interoperability
       * Implementation success rates vary significantly, with larger institutions achieving 45% higher integration rates compared to smaller healthcare facilities
       * Organizations adopting a systematic approach to technology transformation, including staff training and change management programs, can boost interoperability success by up to 50%
   * **Core Technical Challenges in Data**
       * Data format inconsistencies across healthcare platforms
       * Semantic interoperability challenges
       * Real-time data synchronization
       * Security and privacy compliance
   * **AI-Driven Solutions for Data Harmonization**
       * Machine learning algorithms
       * Natural Language Processing
       * Federated Learning Frameworks - most recommended
           * Aids with securing data practices - data privacy, and data harmonization.
           * Enables cross-organizational research
   * **Implementation Framework and Architecture**
       * Cloud based microservices architecture
       * Integration with existing healthcare workflows
       * Healthcare data quality framework 
           * Data governance quality
           * Consider the data consistency, completeness, correctness, timeliness, and accuracy
           * Data Storage
       * Scalable infrastructure design 
           * Event driven architecture  
           * Containerized architecture
           * Cloud based architecture

   * **Questions**
       * Do you have any examples of AI integration in the healthcare system in your local context? Moctar
           * None for now.
       * Federated Learning Frameworks is recommended from your presentation as one of the AI driven solutions for data harmonisation, as it aids with securing data practice, and enable cross organisational research. How do you think DSWB can utilise this effectively? Especially as we have some technical partners working on it.
           * It can aid data privacy across the different countries.

## Previous Notes

   * Introduced Bami to some members of the community and had an onboarding call with her.
