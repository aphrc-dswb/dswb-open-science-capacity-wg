  ## Notes

   * Samuel:
       * The use process is not very linear.
       * More thinking should be done with regards to choice of technology being used, model, and the possible output. 
       * In building these models, a feedback loop should be created to make space for future data and other kinds of changes that moight be encountered. An iterative process should be implemented.
       * Cost implication should also be considered in cases of capacity building and the tools to be created.
       * Some issues that might come up with respect to real time data:
           * Infrastructure - for example, devices, and internet
           * 
   * Moussa - Relating to dengue fever currently working on:
       * Challenges:
           * Rapid diagnosis: Current experience is results being sent to the central department, and having them come back after a week. 
       * Proposed solutions:
           * Rapid diagnosis in site level - instead of central level. 
           * GPS recording to know what is currently happening
           * Weather data, mobility patterns, AI powered system to be able to have early warning for Senegalese government
           * have early discussions with local authority
       * Costing
           * Government resources: Internet and intranet system
               * Utilising government services
               * Save cost by adopting public infrastructure
       * Is it possible to have infrastructure from Africa CDC, and use them across other countries? - Malvika
           * The Africa CDC uses data from Senegal 
       * Can the APHRC use the advisory of the Africa CDC to assess these situations and provide guidance on appropriate responses in these cases.
           * UNESCO infrastructure also depend on local govt funding - but have developed open source tools that can be adopted for capacity building and education in health
               * Public good alliance: [https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/registry](https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/registry) 
           * MS can invite one of the personnels from UNESCO to WG meetings to learn of the public infrastructure tools, and how we might be able to possibly adopt them.
               * Samuel - mentions capacity building internally (possibly), and what we can adopt.
       * Some tools from the paper that have been created [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36370729/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36370729/)
  
   * Sustainability:
       * With respect to the DSWB project:
           * Is it something we should start thinking about?
           * What do we have in mind for sustaining the DSWB project after it ends? 
       * We have had discussion on this during the launch
           * Something we need to go back to and consider
           * If we develop good tools, and have done good job, evidence can show potential for future funding
           * Also need to involve government so they have early buy in
           * Is the project linked to the national systems? 
           * We may get funding, but it would be minimal?
           * From the DSWB fellowship, we can have champions within the ministry, that can help "keep the torch going."
   * Feedback on journal club format:
       * Presentation
       * Article would be sent around at least two weeks in advance.
   * AI tools for literature review
       * Notebook LM
       * Perplexity AI: [http://perplexity.ai/](http://perplexity.ai/)
