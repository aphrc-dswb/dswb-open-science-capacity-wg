## Notes

   * **Upload-a-thon on Zenodo!**
       * Resource on Ways of Working about Zenodo: [https://aphrc-dswb.github.io/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/zenodo-guide](https://aphrc-dswb.github.io/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/zenodo-guide)
       * How to sign up:  [https://zenodo.org/](https://zenodo.org/)
   * **Questions:**
       * Other alternatives: figshare. Zenodo is preferred as it has a community feature.
       * Is it different from GitHub? Yes. Zenodo allows others cite your work, and each of them can have DOI. Zenodo however, has integrated with GitHub, so users can connect their repositories to GitHub and users can cite them. It is not default, so you have to take snapshots.
       * How to delete files from Zenodo: The feature is not really present, so you should upload a new version. However, if you absolutely need to delete, you can send an email to the Zenodo team.
       * What if you upload a file that is incorrect: Please ask your manager before uploading a file.
   * **Add a general guidelines/tips file to the Ways of Working document:** 
       * Should include:
           * Guidelines around sharing information:
               * Ask your manager before uploading a file
               * Don't share sensitive information
               * Make sure the files shared are within the DSWB Data Sharing Agreement
