## Notes

   * The IRESSEF team had a meeting with the OSPO Now team and got some help on their hackathon planning. They are currently taking some of the feedback and would be implementing them on the organisation of the hackathon.
       * A checklist has been made for teams to follow and receive support when planning their hackathons:

       * Moctar and Daffe are the core leads for the organising team, and they would invite support from some other members of the DSWB community, like the OS-CB leads: Malvika and Precious. 

   * Create a group for book dash where Daffe and Winston can write in french, and then maybe translate in English as they are both interested in air pollution.
