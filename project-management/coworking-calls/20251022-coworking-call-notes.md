_Ogbechie, M.-D., Fischer Walker, C., Lee, M.-T., Gana, A. A., Oduola, A., Idemudia, A., Edor, M., Harris, E. L., Stephens, J., Gao, X., Chen, P.-L., & Persaud, N. E. (2024). Predicting treatment interruption among people living with HIV in Nigeria: Machine learning approach. JMIR Public Health and Surveillance, 10, e55473. https://doi.org/10.2196/55473_

- **Methodology:**
  - Routine data was collected from the VIH system, about 95,000 patients.
- **The various variables considered:**
  - Age, sex, duration of ART, history of missed visits,
  - Comparing models, the resulting 0.85  and 0.74 were more favourable models to work with.
- **Strengths:**
  - The data sample size was large - 95,000 patients. 
  - The four best AI models were used.
  - Real-world data was used from the national EMR system.
  - The variables analyzed were very important
- **Limitations:**
  - There was a lot of missing data
  - Some variables like economic standing, behavioral patterns, were not analysed.
  - External validation -  we do not know if the models used can be reused in a different context with another type of data. The sustainability of the training model developed is unknown. 
- **Implications of research:**
  - Critical factor: The biological failure and the factors associated with these biological failures.
  - Propose a multidimensional approach to analyzing the data from a national level, as there are contacts with the ministry that has data from about 5 years.  Having more variables enables us to have more robust models.
- **Questions:**
  - The variables not used as stated in the limitations observed, does it significantly affect the quality of the data?
  - Answer: There is no way to say, with respect to that research, as we see that their research had good outcomes.
