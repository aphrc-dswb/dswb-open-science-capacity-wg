## Previous Notes

### Things we worked on

   * The IRESSEF team had a meeting with OSPO Now to get support for their hackathon, and would be implementing the feedback in their plans. Moctar and Daffe are the core leads for the organising team, and they would invite support from some other members of the DSWB community, like the OS-CB leads: Malvika and Precious
   * Conversations around Book Dash were french speakers can write chapters in french.
   * Daffe brought up establishing Open Science communities in Senegal. 
     * Explore Open Science communities in Africa, and find out which ones are in our network, so we can grow an open science community in Senegal.
