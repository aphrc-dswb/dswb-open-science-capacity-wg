## Notes

   * Main Room Conversation:
       * Indicate your preference for presentation topics and your availability using this form: [https://forms.gle/Gxpt3AiLbGE6RekM6](https://forms.gle/Gxpt3AiLbGE6RekM6)  
       * Continue our plans for a Journal Club - we started this discussion last week, so there is still time for you to help us shape this based on your team's interest.
   * Moussa \& Moctar
       * Want to begin plans on hackathon for IRESSEF, and seeking feedback from Malvika, and everyone else.
       * Is it okay to have more than one interests? It is okay to have two to three ideas, to broaden what participants can participate in. 
       * What are some objectives they can explore for their hackthon?
           * Data quality improvements? Like data cleaning, etc. 
           * Issues around anti-poison, and how the ministry of health can benefit from them.
               * Guidelines: 
                   * Assess the quality/appropriateness/sensitivity of data being used: [https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2024-06/neurips-2023-how-to-data-in-datathons-paper-datasets\_and\_benchmarks.pdf](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2024-06/neurips-2023-how-to-data-in-datathons-paper-datasets\_and\_benchmarks.pdf).
                   * If the data is sensitive, then it has to be anonymised.
                   * Explore building a tool that can take unstructured data and structure in the right format.
                   * Then taking the structured data and creating an output that you want. 
                   * Ask the Ethiopia team (Yordanos, Akililu, and Betty) for tips and help.
                   * Can ask around for projects building similar things/data can be gotten from: For example: Moler Health:[https://github.com/MolerHealth/MolerHealth-Documentation](https://github.com/MolerHealth/MolerHealth-Documentation)
                   * Moussa: it would be great if what we work on can be used for an in-country partner.
