## Live note-taking

At the Open Science Capacity WorkGroup meetings, we use **Framapad** (https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg) to take notes to allow everyone to contribute to the note-taking.

## Archiving notes

All meeting notes after the meeting are archived in this repository in the [wg-meetings](./wg-meetings) folder.

This repository is regularly updated.
