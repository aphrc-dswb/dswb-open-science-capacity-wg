# Project Management for the WG

*All resources for project management will be shared here.*

In due course, we will centralise information such as:
- People involved, their roles and responsibilities
- Meeting resources and notes

## DSWB Open Science Capacity Building Working Group Meeting

### What do we do? 

Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) is an international initiative, funded by the Wellcome Trust and led by the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC). This project has three overarching objectives: to strengthen data systems in Pathfinder countries, to create a sustainable environment for collaborative AI/ML platforms, and to create a user-friendly platform for AI and Machine Learning (AI/ML) tools. The impact of inequality in data availability and access is evident, particularly in resource-limited settings like many African nations. This African institution-led initiative will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to bridge existing gaps in data accessibility, infrastructure, and expertise. It aims to foster a collaborative environment that empowers African nations to harness the full potential of AI/ML for improving health outcomes. 

The Open Science and Capacity Building Work Group meeting involve us creating, nurturing and educating on the best practices in open source/science to foster successful collaboration and technical skill building across the DSWB community. We support members from Pathfinder Institutions to adapt their ways of working to incorporate responsible and open practices and deploy AI/ML tools for improving health outcomes.


### When do the Meetings Hold? 

The meetings are held once every two weeks. Read our meeting note to [learn about the next one](https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg). You can ask Precious Onyewuchi (@preshh0), Malvika Sharan (@msharan) or Miranda Barasa to add you to the calendar. 

### Who Chairs the OS-CB WG Meeting?

The OS-CB WG meeting is chaired by Malvika Sharan (@msharan) and Precious Onyewuchi (@preshh0).

## Live note-taking

At the Open Science Capacity WorkGroup meetings, we use **Framapad** (https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg) to take notes to allow everyone to contribute to the note-taking.

## Archiving notes

All meeting notes after the meeting are archived in this repository in the [wg-meetings](./wg-meetings) folder.

This repository is regularly updated.

As we progress, this repository would contain the following: 

- Initiatives proposed and in progress
- Learning resources shared in the WG
- Reports and outcomes
- Policies adopted and developed by the WG


See you around!
