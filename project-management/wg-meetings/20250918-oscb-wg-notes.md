## ðŸ“£ Agenda:

   * **Before this meeting:**
       * We are hosting coworking calls every week on Wednesdays: [https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/dswb-coworking-calls](https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/dswb-coworking-calls)

   * **During this meeting:** 
       * The DGH team would be leading a session on Visual Architecture for Research Communication: Making Complex Studies Crystal Clear, highlighting Draw.io - a free and open-source web-based diagramming tool used to create flowcharts, process maps, organizational charts, UML diagrams, network diagrams, and other visuals. 


### Notes

   * **Topic: Visual Architecture for Research Communication: Making Complex Studies Crystal Clear**
       * **Hidden Crisis in Research Communication**
           * A lot of prose affects how well reviewers can review a paper
       * **The science behind visual processing**
           * The human mind processes images better than it does text. 
       * **The 5-step construction process for a map:**
           * **Map the Journey**
               * Identify start and end points
               * What enters your study? (participants, data, samples)
               * What exists your study? (conclusions, outcomes, results)
           * **Identify Decision Points**
               * Find the critical branches
               * Where do you make choices that affect outcomes?
               * What criteria determine next steps?
           * **Show Data Flow**
               * Trace how information moves
               * How does raw data become processed results?
               * What transformations occur at each step?
           * **Add Context**
               * Include essential details
               * Sample sizes, timepoints, key criteria
               * Methods and tools used at each stage
           * **Simplify and Polish**
               * Make it reader-friendly
               * Remove unnecessary complexity
               * Ensure consistent styling and clear labels
       * **Using Draw.io:** [http://draw.io/](http://draw.io/)
           * Free and available to use compared to the other options
           * When using draw.io, using AI from scratch can alter your expected output. It is better to use AI as a guide, using specific prompts for the result you need, and then work alongside it. 
           * Different shapes on the tool mean different things. 
               * Rectangles: Processes, actions, steps
               * Diamonds: Decisions, yes/no points
               * Circles/Ovals: Start/end points
               * Parallelograms: Data/inputs/outputs
           * If a colleague can't understand your study design from the flowchart alone in 2 minutes, it needs simplification.
       * **Recommendations for Use Cases**
           * Beginners: Start with Draw.io - free, powerful, intuitive
           * Life Sciences: BioRender for publication-quality scientific figures
           * Teams: Lucidchart for real-time collaboration
           * Budget-conscious: Google Drawings for basic needs
           * Advanced users: Adobe Illustrator for maximum control
                
### Notes from previous meeting

   * We had an external webinar session on Synthetic Data Generation.
