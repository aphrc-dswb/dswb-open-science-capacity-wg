# Open Science and Capacity Building Working Group Meeting

**Date: July 11 2024**

In Attendance: 

* Jim
* Jay
* Miranda
* Aminata
* Moustapha

## Key Points Discussed:

**Attendance and Awareness:**

   * Mokhtar suggested making the meeting more well-known and ensuring people are reminded to attend.
     
**Agenda and Meeting Structure:**

   * Emphasis on having a structured agenda for each meeting to ensure productive discussions. 
   * Suggestions to include capacity building and reviews of open science resources as potential agenda items. 
   * Miranda agreed to draft an agenda for the next meeting and requested input.

**Open Science and Capacity Building**

   * IRESSEF team noted that a needs assessment questionnaire had been previously mentioned by Malvika but the team had not completed it. 
   * The needs assessment focuses on open science and capacity building.
   * Capacity building was identified as the initial focus, with open science being a significant component.

**September Training Workshop**

Upcoming workshop in September will include technical training, ethical AI, and the use of open-source tools like GitHub. The training will focus on the OMOP common data model with opportunities to include relevant analysis tools like SQL and Python.

   * Each  Pathfinder group is expected to send 10-12 data scientists for the   training. 
   * Identified key training needs, including tools for data analysis like Python and R. 
   * Discussed various training delivery methods, including face-to-face, virtual sessions, or a combination. 
   * Virtual training is considered beneficial, potentially structured as regular sessions over a week. 
   * Discussed the potential usefulness of training in metadata, with a focus on prioritizing data analysis tools initially. 
   * Suggestion to combine metadata training with data analysis or schedule it for a later stage. 
   * Discussed whether data analysis training should focus on tools within OMOP, such as Atlas, or specific packages like Python and R. 
   * The need to identify the most relevant tools and packages for data analysis was highlighted.

**Data Submission and Assessment Tools:**

   * The importance of exploring data analysis tools within working groups is highlighted as an essential starting point. 
   * A total of 13 databases were submitted, covering areas such as COVID and HIV. 
   * Discussion on the number of databases submitted from each side, with a total of 16 databases identified. 
   * Some datasets still need sorting and submission. The group acknowledged the previous deadline but agreed additional data might still be possible. 
   * Mustafa suggested sending an email to Steve to check if the submission link is still active. 
   * Jim proposed keeping the submission link open to allow for the addition of new datasets as they become available. 
   * As participants become more proficient with the processes, it will become easier to utilize new data. 
   * Discussed revisiting and modifying submitted forms as some items might need changes or additions.

**Training Needs and Prioritization:**

   * Discussed the list of tools needing training, including R, Python, and SQL. 
   * The challenge of determining the most critical training needs and creating a structured training plan is acknowledged. Input from all Pathfinders is necessary to ensure correct prioritization.

**Meeting Scheduling and Attendance:**

   * Current meeting times might not be suitable for all participants, especially those from Ethiopia and Cameroon.
   * Suggested slotting the meetings between other key meetings to improve attendance and participation. 
   * Emphasized the importance of ensuring representation from all relevant groups. 
   * Proposed having a progress meeting one week followed by working group meetings the next week to balance the workload and attendance.

**Next Steps:**

   * Confirm the status of the submission link for further dataset submissions. 
   * Develop a structured training plan based on prioritized needs and ensure alignment with the Platforms Working Group. 
   * Adjust meeting schedules to accommodate better participation and revive group membership as necessary. 
   * Distribute and complete the needs assessment tool. 
   * Confirm attendance and finalize the training list for the September workshop. 
   * Align schedules and coordinate with the Platforms Working Group. 
   * Follow up with Pathfinders to ensure representation and participation in future meetings.
