## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes

1. Review of last meeting:

   * Discord
   * GitHub
   * 1:1 on community design

2. Open Collaboration: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pi08LuzFvHZQGAY1iOyqNcUffWpbSa9u/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=101082273592879353430\&rtpof=true\&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pi08LuzFvHZQGAY1iOyqNcUffWpbSa9u/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=101082273592879353430\&rtpof=true\&sd=true)

   * Lowering the barriers.
   * Meeting people where they are.
   * Collecting data to understand.
   * Starting was slow - talk to people, understand what is working and not working.
   * Changes were implemented, and feedback was gotten on these changes from the stakeholders.
   * Diverse group - diverse perspectives:
       * Defined roles, open communication.
   * Challenges: Getting data from sites (raw data) NDA, DSA etc.
       * Very good learning process - requires engagement with people.
       * Making data global.
       * Convincing people is hard - but it was successful as we spoke with people!
   * Interaction with the right people who can move along the process:
       * Developing documentation.

2. Breakout discussion on Open Collaboration from YOUR perspective

**Prompts**

In your breakout room please discuss the following prompt:

   * Why do you think it is important to define ways of working in DSWB?
   * What are some risks of not defining ways of working?
   * Are there some barriers you have already faced that should be prioritised in defining the ways of working?
   * What is the ideal future that a well defined ways of working can get us to achieve?
     
Please take notes from your group discussion in Framapad as we will do a quick report out after the breakout session.


**Notes**

**Group 4:**

   * Question One: Why do you think it is important to define ways of working in DSWB?
       * For the sake of consistency.
       * Provides clarity on how the project should be run/what should be done.

**Group 1:**

* Question 1: Why do you think it is important to define ways of working in DSWB?

   * Establishing communication to minimize delays.
   * Improve clear understanding of the roadmap.
   * Sometimes we can look so quiet or not interested, but we just don't have some topics that allow us to use the tools like GitHub or Discord. We know how is important to use these tools in this project, we did our research seminar and we defined some areas for exchanges maybe it's time to use the tools with other pathfinders or technical partners.
   * Roles and responsibilities enable us to have clear expectations and avoid conflicts.
   * Accountability and sharing responsibilities.
   * Collaboration will foster skill building - people will be able to gain knowledge they didn't have:
       * GitHub
         
* Question 2: What are some risks of not defining ways of working?

   * 

* Question Four: What is the ideal future that well-defined ways of working can get us to achieve?

   * Not easy to use Github, we need more tutorials
