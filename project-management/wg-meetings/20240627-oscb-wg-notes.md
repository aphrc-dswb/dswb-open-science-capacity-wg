# Open Science and Capacity Building Working Group Meeting

Date: June 27th, 2024

## ðŸ‘‹  Icebreaker 

*(Getting to know each other and this Etherpad for collaborative notes)*

**Name / Organisation and location you are joining from** 

   * Jim 
   * Moctar 
   * Miranda 
   * Malvika 
   * Moussa

## ðŸ“£ Agenda:

   * Provide overview of what has happened so far in the WG
   * Plan what will happen next: follow up and succession plan for the working group

## Notes

   * What does capacity building in DSWB look like?
       * Training in technical skills
       * Supervising graduate students
   * Building critical mass: 
       * How can we coordinate with all teams?
       * Scaling this group by training
   * Delivering on the goals
       * The Turing Way
           * Book: [https://book.the-turing-way.org/](https://book.the-turing-way.org/)
           * Training materials targeted to senior researchers: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience)
           * Pathway for DSWB can be developed: [https://book.the-turing-way.org/#different-pathways](https://book.the-turing-way.org/#different-pathways)
               * Curating resources that DSWB needs
               * Identifying what we can add (case studies, examples)
           * We also have training materials for technical skills
       * Ethical AI
   * We have not reached out to partners yet
       * Open safely (trusted research environment)
       * We don't have to be limited to the UK
   * What do we want to teach now?
       * Version control
       * Basic DMP, open science
       * Open science?
           * We have training materials: [https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/](https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/)
               * Video library: [https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/library.html](https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/library.html)
   * September: training will be delivered
       * OMOP
       * Open Science
   * Malvika will connect with Bioinformatics Hub Kenya and see if they can deliver training
   * For the next months, this can be a good place to plan the training
       * Steve is working on that -- we can ask them to join these meetings
   * Ethical AI:
       * We have resources like: [https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/turing-commons/skills-tracks/aeg/index.html#chapter-outline](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/turing-commons/skills-tracks/aeg/index.html#chapter-outline)
       * BUT, we should reach out to the local ethicists and lead journal club
       * Reflection on African contexts, francophone contexts
       * Seminar series can be run
   * Open source tools and training
       * License, guidance, attribution
       * Clarity on the rights: How can someone work on my GitHub, and what should they do if reusing my work?


### Action

   * Action: use this working group for planning the open science training
       * Invite Steve, look at the agenda, and assess what topics are needed
       * Look at who is locally available (like Angela and Bioinformatics Hub Kenya) that can deliver training
       * Ethics: think about a keynote or panel for ethics -- training may not be possible
   * Identifying representative from each team in DSWB to join this WG
       * After September training, this working group can become a place for discussions on open science
   * Future: Train the trainer to build capacity for this group
       * Get more people to be confident in delivering training
       * Building generalist skills so people can support different teams
