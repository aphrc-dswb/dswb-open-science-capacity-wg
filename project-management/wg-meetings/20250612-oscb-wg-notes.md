## ðŸ“£ Agenda:

**Before this meeting:**

   * Check out the template for Challenge Clinic, a meeting format we will try out this week: [https://github.com/aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/blob/8a09a7f62f1173a1719f98ec34ccddf08405e91f/project-management/collaboration/challenge-clinic.md](https://github.com/aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/blob/8a09a7f62f1173a1719f98ec34ccddf08405e91f/project-management/collaboration/challenge-clinic.md)

**During this meeting: Agenda**

   * Malvika will be presenting about authorship, CREDIT taxonomy and acknowledgements, and invite discussions on their relevance in your data science project.


### Notes

   * Open Access:
       * Was first developed in 2002 and 2003
   * In order for people to be able to use your work/reproduce it, you need to be able to provide the code, and the virtual environment you initially created your work in so it can be reproduced.
   * Contributorship and Authorship are different. 
       * We are looking to embrace more of contributorship as people outisde academia are a part of creating scientific articles.
   * We want to reward: 
       * Research environement
       * Tools
       * Reproducible workflow
       * Documentation, etc
   * Credit Taxonomy:
       * You can describe the different contributions to a project, and specify who made them. 
       * Limitations:
           * Has 14 contributor roles.
           * Published by a group of people, not a community. 
           * Types of contributions to be explored can be improved outside these 14 roles.
       * It is important to factor DEI 
       * Organisations similar to Credit Taxonomy
           * Responsible research assessment
           * coalition for advancing research assessment
           * resume for researchers
           * dutch recognition and rewards
       * ORCID:
           * Allows you to have all your articles/publications collated in one resource.
       * Persistent/Unique Identifiers
           * Authors and Individuals: ORCID
           * Research outputs: Zenodo, Figshare
           * Articles: DOI
           * Book: ISBN
           * Webpage: Webarchive version can be hosted on [http://web.archive.org/](http://web.archive.org/)
           * RoHub for projects
       * Ways to recognise contributions:
           * All-contributors bot by the Turing Way
           * Crowdin allows contributors be credited adequately
           * Record of Contributions: Allows contributors know how to add details about their contributions, and have personal links they can share as references to their work.
       * Equitable Crediting:
           * We can adopt all-contributors in our github
           * the rewards to be created should match with what contributors find useful/prefer. 
   * Question:
       * On GitHub we often see Contributors is it similar for research field? - Ousmane
           * It is quite different from acknowledgment in research
       * Is there any cross-check with the contents of contributors? - Moctar
           * This responsibility would be to the most senior author, and there is provision for specific contributions to be stated.
           * How can we contribute on the turing way? Are there any thematic areas? - Mulugeta
               * Book Dash: [https://github.com/aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/issues/48](https://github.com/aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/issues/48)
                   * review existing chapters
               * You can look through the existing pathway
               * Thematic areas are o Data Science
           * In the context of DSWB we work on data, papers or new solutions what are the use case if we want to contribute ?
           * In the context of DSWB we work on data, papers or new solutions what are the use case if we want to contribute ? - Ousmane
               * How can we contribute in the different contexts we have, and how would we like that to be recognised? 

         **Breakout Room:**
           * **Question: Please identify different kinds of contributions you would like to recognise in your project within DSWB.**
               * Group 1 : Ousmane \& Moctar
                   * OMOP process database on Github for 2 or 3 datasets
                   * Sharing datasets
                   * Catalog for data mapping

               * Group 2: Precious \& Winston \& Raissa
                   * Contributions to NEEDS Assessment
                   * Contributions to situational analysis
                   * Minutes/notes taking during meetings
                   * Winston and Luc are doing transcription for the situational analysis in french and english
                   * Upcoming datathon, acknowledge the planning committee
                   * Acknowledge selections/participations into data science programs/communities
               * Group 3
                   *  Data contributions - sharing of datasets, maintaining catalogs
                   * Stakeholder engagement plan
                   * Technical platform development - contribution to front end development, back end etc
