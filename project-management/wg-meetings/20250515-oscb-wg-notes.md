During this meeting: Agenda

   * Try out a challenge clinic - a format we would like to introduce and run periodically as part of the future WG meetings.


### Describing your challenge

Please share any critical situation/problem from your project/team that is/was particularly challenging for you to deal with recently. It can be about data sharing, collaboration, project management or any skills/capacity-related issue. You can use the following prompts to think about and add details about your challenge.

Template

   * *Name: [YOUR NAME]*
       * *What open science and capacity building-related challenge am I currently encountering in my project? **(Clearly describe the specific challenge you are facing.)***

Use one of the section below to add your challenge

Challenge 1

   * Name: Daffe
       * Challenge: 
           * Air Pollution: Do we have the available **data,** to carry out the research topic? 
       * Indicators of challenge:
           * Some data is available, but others from external bodies might be missing or incomplete.
       * Collaborators:
           * Some members of the DGH team. 
       * Additional comments: 


Challenge 2

   * Name: Reinpeter
       * Challenge: Supporting of Standadization and Harmonization of  Data from AHRI
       * Indicators of challenge: Data is available but there is issues with data sharing
       * Collaborators: Miranda
       * Additional comments: Data sharing agreement is in the process of being signed by the Pathfinders.
           * When approved the DSA will help us in sharing data
           * The DSA is cross-country - collaborative data sharing
       * Action:
           * Ask miranda to have a deadline so we know when this DSA is operationalised.
           * Draft - 8.1 should be discussed with the legal team: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUTzZ2KYQ-W1ICEtIr-\_s2ZiF\_sQnoEq/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUTzZ2KYQ-W1ICEtIr-\_s2ZiF\_sQnoEq/edit)
Notes:
       * There has been some challenges around Data Sharing:
           * Not having a DSA has made it a little difficult to understand/streamline processes around data sharing. 
           * Limited understanding in knowing how to share data amongst pathfinder countries.
       * DSA 8.1 - Following Wellcome's guidelines:
           * The tools/methods used in analysing this data should follow open source/science principles.
           * Partners should not have to sign NDAs to access the data.  
           * If something of commercial capacity has to be made, APHRC should be aware of it, and they can inform Wellcome which would let the partner know what to do. 
           * Reminder to ensure to handle sensitive data properly.

Challenge 3

   * Name: Anicet Onana
       * Challenge: We have seen low level of engagement in this group.
       * Indicators of challenge:
       * Collaborators:
       * Additional comments: 

Challenge 4

   * Name: Brenda
       * Challenge: Having missing data in our dataset at DGH and how to deal with them
       * Indicators of challenge: incomplete data can lead to inaccuracy in making inferences. its difficult because we have to go back to review patient records, which is time consuming 
       * Collaborators: DGH team and DSWB technical team supporting 
       * Additional comments: 
           * IRESSEF has similar challenges. There is plans to create an automation that can check for missing data/outliers. 
           * AHRI - Missing Data:
               * Sometimes hierarchy questions with blanks in succeeding questions can enable analysts fill in the blanks as unanaswered questions have meanings.
               * For example: "Have you ever smoked before?" An answer of yes/no/no idea lets you know what might be a possible answer to "Are you currently smoking?"
               * Answers should be reviewed with minimal bias.
               * AI:
                   * Malvika would share some notes/links to some research by the Turing Way/Roche Foundation on missing data in unstructured data.

Challenge 5

   * Name: Malvika
       * Challenge: Digitalising handwritten data - such as in medical health record.
       * Indicators of challenge: A lot of data is not currently existing. 
       * Collaborators:
       * Additional comments: 
           * The problem might be beyond digitalization, following up patient's by unique IDs to keep track of their health history, and ensure it is uniform across various health institutions.
           * Trialling a smaller set of data as prototypes for digitizing would be a great way to test out solutions.
               * It could be a great hackathon challenge to work with/on. 

## Additional Notes

   * Think about identifying individuals within the team that might be able to provide solutions to problem with their various skillsets.
   * Do we share our WG with other fellows in the pathfinder countries so they can join/participate in these meetings.
   * AI for Precious: Check the sheet and send out invites to suggested speakers.

### Notes from previous meeting

   * Last two meetings did not hold due to public holiday.
   * Previous meeting on the 3rd of April was on hackathons.
