## ğŸ“£ Agenda

## Panel Discussion â€“ Daniel Mwanga  
**Estimated Time:**  20min  
**Host:** Laurah Ondari 

### Speaker Bio

**Daniel Mwanga** is a senior data scientist at APHRC, leading efforts on data governance through the Data Science Program and the Data Synergy and Evaluations Unit. His interests lie in applying data science, statistics, and governance principles to support evidence-informed decision-making across Africa. He also has deep expertise in impact evaluation and data systems.

### ğŸ’¬ Discussion Points

#### 1. In the African context, where access, privacy, and infrastructure vary widely, what does this mean practically for research institutions?

- Data protection ensures that individualsâ€™ rights are safeguarded against breaches or harms.  
- Responsibility lies with data handlers to protect subjects from risks associated with unauthorized data access or use.

#### 2. Only 60% of surveyed institutions reported having data governance frameworks. What minimum standards or structures should be prioritized to protect data responsibly while enabling research?

- Despite varying capacities, the core goal remains: to safeguard data subjects.  

**Key Components of Data Protection:**
- **People:** Researchers, legal officers, data scientists, organization staff  
- **Processes:** Organizational culture, legal obligations, internal frameworks  
- **Technology:** Software and tools that support privacy and secure data processing

**Capacity Building:**
- Institutions must train staff in anonymization and data management.  
- Ongoing learning to keep up with evolving technologies and regulations.

#### 3. How can African research institutions build data protection frameworks that are proactive about AIâ€™s ethical and legal risks in health and education research?

- Open Science encourages wider access to anonymized data via repositories.  

**Safeguards:**
- Anonymization before sharing  
- Proper metadata and documentation  
- Legal compliance (territorial laws matter)

### Audience Q&A Highlights

- **Safe data use in Open Science?**  
  > Harm reduction and benefit to the public must be prioritized.

- **Successful data-sharing projects in Africa?**  
  > APHRC projects show successful sharing via clear data-sharing agreements.

- **Leadership commitment?**  
  > Data protection frameworks only work if backed by top-level support.

- **Ownership vs openness?**  
  > Licensing (e.g. Creative Commons) helps protect work while enabling access.

- **Legal and ethical risk of sharing with authorities?**  
  > Consider national laws and risks of identifiability.

- **Data protection vs open data?**  
  > A delicate balanceâ€”sharing responsibly without compromising individuals.

- **Responsibility: Data scientist or cybersecurity expert?**  
  > Both, depending on the data lifecycle stage, legal experts also play a key role.

- **Who should act as the Data Protection Officer (DPO)?**  
  > In research orgs, a shared role between legal and data experts may work best.
