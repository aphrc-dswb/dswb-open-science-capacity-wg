   * discuss with the AHRI team on their upcoming hackathon, which will allow the rest of us to learn from them and plan future hackathons/similar events locally.  

**After this meeting:**

   *  Action Items would be noted, and put in place.

## Notes

   * Formats of Hackathons:
       * Hackathons
       * Datathons
       * Edit-athons
   * Timeline: 3-6 months
       * Event phase: Online events run for longer than physical events run for.
       * Post event phase: 
           * Collect feedback
           * Follow up
           * Receive feedback
       * Event considerations:
           * Goals
           * Audience
           * Challenges
           * Logistics
           * Community building
           * Mentorships
           * Prizes - think beyond money. It can be trainings, future access.
       * Legal/Ethical Considerations:
           * Don't share sensitive data
           * Divide the contribution into three phases: 
               * Beginner
               * Intermediate
               * Professional
           * Do a risk assessment
   * Question:
       * If you're pressed for time, what is a minimum time to run a hackathon? 
           * 2 months - especially if they are within an internal community. 
       * What teams are planning hackathons soon, and what support would you need:
   * Contribution: Combining hackathon with training
       * Ousmane: Got a week of training with small dataset and second week of working on a challenge (maleria data)
           * Used Kaggle
   * Question: 
       * Did the AHRI use this same format to plan their hackathon, and what was their experience in planning? 
           * Unsure, but we would find out next week. 
           * Members can also ask for support. 

   * Data Study Group format:
       * Crowd source solutions
       * Get post doc students to act as mentors
       * Early career researchers can join and contribute to solving these challenges

   * Part of the benefits of planning a hackathon early is so data can be assessed, and we can know what resources are available to us. 

Things to have in mind when planning a hackathon:

   * What are we trying to address? What goals are we looking to achieve? 
   * Who are the audience for these challenges/hackathon? 
   * What are the resources we have available for participants

In summary: right people, right data, right problem.
