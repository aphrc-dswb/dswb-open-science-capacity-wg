# Open Science and Capacity Building Working Group Meeting

Date: January 23rd, 2025

## ðŸ‘‹  Icebreaker 

*(Getting to know each other and this Etherpad for collaborative notes)*

**Name / Organisation / What has been one of your highlights as part of DSWB this year?** 

   * Malvika / Seeing people in Ethiopia and GitHub organisation starting!
   * Precious/Teaching about GitHub, and 1:1 meetings. 

## ðŸ“£ Agenda:

**Before this meeting:**

  * We are hosting coworking calls - join us on Wednesdays - 15:00 EAT: https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/dswb-coworking-calls.

**During this meeting:**

  * Welcome and Review of last year's meetings. 
  * Practical discussion and hands on curation of The Turing Way resources for DSWB project teams.
  * Breakout activity and report out.
  * What specific data science practices does your project require right now that you'd like all team members to know?
  * What is causing challenges in advancing your projects -- what practices, guidance and frameworks are needed to address them?
  * Which of these practices exist currently in The Turing Way that we can curate and share in DSWB?
  * What practices are not yet discussed that we want to encourage community members to develop?
  * AOB
    
**After this meeting:**

  * Please join coworking calls to work on DSWB related responsibilities: https://github.com/aphrc-dswb. 
  * You can reach out to Malvika and Precious for any questions you have.

## Notes

   * Current best practices of the Turing Way, and how they apply to DSWB
      * Making use of the Turing Book, and learning the pathways we need as a community.
      * Identify the gaps, and how they can be worked on:
        * No-code platforms.
        * What are some solutions for LMIC?
      * We do not have to reinvent the wheel, but:
        * We would create case studies for DSWB.
        * We can create a handbook derived from the Turing Book. Example: https://edsbook.org/welcome.html

     * [https://carpentries.org/lessons/](https://carpentries.org/lessons/)
       
   * Lack of Data dictionary
     
   * Fair principles
      * [https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-fair.html](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-fair.html)
 
   * Data governance
       * Curate from other sources
         
   * Data cleaning
       * [https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-data-curation.html](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-data-curation.html)

   * Capacity building
       * [https://book.the-turing-way.org/collaboration/new-community](https://book.the-turing-way.org/collaboration/new-community)
   
   * Lack of meta-data
       * [https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/sdp/metadata.html](https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/sdp/metadata.html)
         
**Question Two:**
       * Strengthen capacity: Lack of data scientist and skills in DGH
       * Digitizing our data 
       * Data cleaning 
       * ETL process (extract, transform, load) in OMOP 
       * Research data management


Group 2: Rachel | Rosa

**Notes**

**Question One:**

   * Data integration process
       * Collecting diverse data from diverse sources
   * Conducting reproducible research
       * Managing a distributed community that can reproduce work
   * Building a network of partners
   * Building success indicators


**Question Two:** 

   * Lack of high-quality data in Ethiopia
   * Documentation guidelines
   * Reference and archiving


Group 3: Samba | Moctar | Yordanos

**Notes**

**Question One:**

   * Master GitHub. 
   * Data management skills
       * Standardization and harmonization
   * Data standards


**Question Two:** 

   * Capacity building: It would help if we have more practice on these tools during working group meetings - GitHub (DGH). 
   * data standardization and management (DGH).
       * Team members learning about OMOP
   * Problem understanding guides written in English, it would be great if we got bilingual resources or tools that aid translations (DGH)
       * French translation happening here: 
   * Data is not organized in the FAIR principles and it would be great if information on that is shared (AHRI).


**Suggestion:** Include Data Scientists in their Pathfinder orgs as they may be more equipped to give information on what might be lacking (DGH).


**4. Open Q\&A**


**5. AOB**
