### Notes
   * **Topic: Unlocking the power of Regulatory Sandboxes for Ethical and Secure Data Science**
   * **Sandboxing:**
       * A method that provides a safe environment for data, and to test AI models.

   * **Overview of Regulatory Sandboxes:**
       * **Definitions:**
           * a tool for developing evidence about how a new product, technology, or business model (innovation) works and the outcomes it produces", as "a controlled, time-bound, live testing environment, which may feature regulatory waivers at regulators' discretion".
           * "a limited form of regulatory waiver or flexibility for firms, enabling them to test new business models with reduced regulatory requirements"
      
       * Different from operational sandboxes which adefined sa secure and colaborative data spaces that pool daatsets and resources together. They are usually hosted by one entity and can be accessed by others.
       * They can be created by regulators and government agencies
           * An example:
               * Health data research UK (HDRUK)
       * There are opportunities for regulatory sandboxes and operational sandboxes to be combined together.
       * **Features:**
           * **Testing Area:**
               * A regular testing area for innovators to experiment with virtual environments and people. 
           * **Collaboration:**
               * Regulators have taken up the role of clearing the innovation pathway by removing the regulatory barriers innovators face, so partnerships can be formed and protection for future blockers are put in place. These partnerships can happen with the innovators, the government, academia and regulators.
           * **Regulatory exploration:**
               * Real and perceived barriers are explored, and customer protection mechanisms are required, including the consideration of present and future legislative positions. It removes the occurence of a "green light" and "red light" approcah. A green light approach is acceptancr of an innovation into the market without proper checks, which cna be dangerous, and a red light approach is banning innovations, whuch can also be unbeneficial as innovators and the benefits of these innovations can be frsutrated.
               * Sandboxes provide a balance between both sides, as innovators and regualtors are working together to come up with solutions that benefit the regulator, the innovator and the public.
                   * Regualtors are able to create policies and laws that protect the public, and also benefit the innovator.
                   * Innovators are able to create products and benefit from policies that encourage their work
                   * The public are abke to benefit from innovation, and variety of options. 
           * **Data generation**

       * **Workflow:**
           * **Application and review - Sandbox Eligibility Criteria**
               * Genuine innovation: Can have differnt themes - health and data, AI
               * Consumer benefit
           * **Testing design**
               * Regulatory hypothesis, Testing KPIs, Testing Methodology, Patient Enrolment plan, Testing Safeguards, Regulatory flexibilities. reporting timelines and content, exit plans
           * **Test implementation:** Can take different forms, like: 
               * Simulation
               * Virtual Testing
               * Live Testing
           * **Exit** - either as approved to enter the market, or banned.
               * Test starts and can have a number of outcomes:
                   * A test can fail
                   * A test can be discontinued
                   * A test can be successful
                       * A reglatory framrwork can be reevaluated.
           * **Monitoring and evaluation** - across various outcomes in the Health, Regulatory, Firm-level, and Operational and institutional: 
               * Initial mesaurement of applications and cohorts
               * Ongoing monitoring
               * Mid-term and final evaluations
   * **Use cases of National (Data and Privacy) Regulatory Sandboxes**
       * **General Data/Privacy Issues Addressed by Regulatory Sandboxes:**
           * Outdated regulatory frameworks wih respect to new technologies.
           * Cross sectional/converged innovations and confliciting national regulatory frameworks
           * Impact of new data-driven technologues on specific groups/communities (e.g: bias against minorities) or public interest/policy goals (e.g: data privacy)
       * **Specific Data/Privacy Issues Addressed by Regulatory Sandboxes:**
           * Access by researchers/innovators to public and private data repositories.
           * Access by the State's public and private data, for example: mobility data for planning smart citiies. 
           * Access by private entities to public data for commercialization and innovation,
           * Resilience of national data infrastructure in emergency situatons. For exmaple: pandemics and wars.
       * **Some examples:**
           * United Kingdom
               * ICO regulatory sandbox
               * MHRA AI Airlock Regulatory Sandbox
           * Singapore
               * IMDA/PDPC Data Regulatory Sandbox
               * IMDA Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET) Regulatory Sandbox

   * **Regulatory Sandboxes for Cross-Border Data Sharing**
       * **Proposed Cross-Border Regulatory Sandboxes**
           * ASEAN Regulatory Pilot Space (RPS)
               * Cross-Border Nature: participation by ASEAN Member States/regulators.
               * Sandbox Objective: facilitation of CBDF between ASEAN member States.
               * Legal/ Governance framework: Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) \& MoUs between ASEAN regulators.
               * Governing/Operating entity: Joint Supervisory Committee of national DPAS.
               * Sandbox Host: rotating national regulator.
               * Regulatory Powers: exercised by participating national DPAs
               * Applicant Benefits: Access to multiple ASEAN markets, regulatory clarity, and potential fast-track approvals.
               * Regulatory benefits: Enhanced cross-border cooperation, shared best practices, and risk monitoring.
           * Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA) Regulatory Sandbox
           * Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Regional Sandbox
       * **Implemented Cross-Border Regulatory Sandboxes**
           * Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN)
           * ASEAN Financial Innovation Network (AFIN/APIX)
           * The Pacific Regional Regulatory Sandbox
           * The European Blockchain Regulatory Sandbox for Distributed Ledger Technologies


   * **Challenges:**
       * Compliance: Diverse data protection laws add complexity
       * Data localization laws: Require data to be stored and process data within a specific country
       * Security concerns: Transporting data across borders increases security risk and vulnerability of data
       * Technology infrastructure: Cross border data transfers require significant resources and expertise
       * Regulatory uncertainty: Evolving regulations create uncertainty, making it challenging to adapt quickly
       * Impact on customer trust: Failure to safeguard personal data can lead to a loss of customer trust


**Questions and comments**

   * Do we have any use-cases of regulatory sandboxes within Sub-Sahara Africa? If not, what are the possible causalities to this ? - Bonface
       * Some countries are in the process of establishing national sandboxrs
       * So far, we do not have cross-border sandboxes
   * Where does a regualtory sandbox seat in terms of research data, as research data is exempt from personal data protection with the assumption that when research data is shared, it is anonymised?
       * Research data can be subject to regulatory sandbox in the terms that the data is checked to be properly anonymised.
       * Check to ensure that the data is in compliance with usage stipulated? 
           * Assessments to check how the research data used.
   * Who sanctions the establishemnt of regulatory sandboxes?
       * It has to be established by regulaotrs exercising legal powers. However, soemtimes these regulaotry sandboxes are championed by the private sectors as they know their needs more, and they partner with other stakeholders.
       * Inovators have to play an active role in onvolving regualtors in the decision making process of theor innovations, and establishing partnerships - by providing reources and enabling their participation, especially in low resource settings.
                
### Notes from previous meeting

   * We had a concept familiarization on authorship, CREDIT taxonomy and acknowledgements led by Malvika. Afterwards, we had breakout sessions curating
     a list of all kinds of contributions in DSWB projects that we would like to recognise as authorship or contributorhip from WG meeting.
