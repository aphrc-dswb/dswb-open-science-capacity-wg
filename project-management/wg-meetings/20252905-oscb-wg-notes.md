**During this meeting: Agenda**

   * Introduce BHKi and Open Science Africa Colleagues
   * Check in with Ethiopia team about their hackathon.

### Notes

   * Ethiopia team gave a brief summary of their event.
       * How did you handle the data management and handling?
           * Participants signed NDAs, and data was provided for participants to use during the event.
           * Necessary information about the data, like data domain and metadata was shared with the participants to enable them understand based on their expertise.
       * How did you manage the time participants participated in the event? 
           * The participants were stationed in a conducive environment to ensure they were able to participate well, and avoid distractions. 
       * What are the plans for sustainability and continuity of project?
   * Tathagata provided 1-hour mentorship everyday during the week of the hackathon to participants who were working on record linkage (remotely).
       * The time frame was not feasbile for participants to perform record linkage. Given longer time, they could have provided better solutions. 
       * Are the solutions publicly available? Not yet. They are on private repositories.
   * Products/solutions from hackathon would. be shared/exchanged with other pathfinder countries.
   * How can we transition from private to public repositories/projects?
       * They are currently not at the stage where they can be shared publicly - as it was quickly done, and all information has not been processed yet to protect sensitive data, but a paper can be created to discuss about this.
   * Question:
       * How can we explore more open solutions? 

### Notes from previous meeting

   * We held a challenge clinic.
