## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes

   * Thinking about different kinds of outputs at different stages of research: [https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content/open-results/lesson1-research-process-and-results.html](https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content/open-results/lesson1-research-process-and-results.html)
       * Considering what we can open, and what can not be opened
       * Making decisions transparent - avoiding restrictions as much as possible without compromising the  sensitive data or data protection requirement
       * As open as possible, as closed as necessary
   * Jay: I would like to get guidance on a README that OHDSI and APHRC are building that put together several containers in a container and grows the containers we used to deploy OHDSI on laptops and servers during the recent training
