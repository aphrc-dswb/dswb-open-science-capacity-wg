## Notes

We have followed up on your input and curated chapters based on the feedback. We want to ask you to review them:

* It woud be great if these resources shared can be looked at by the community members, and their input added to these curated chapters.
* A chapter would be given to community members to review, suggest changes and update. 

**What are the plans to get inputs from people outside the WG?**

* Book dash event planned for DSWB members to review and update these curated chapters or write those that are currently missing
  * They can be a part of the Book Dash (https://deploy-preview-4043--the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html). This would be an event where anyone within the DSWB community who might be interested in contributing to the curated set of chapters, or add new ones that would be needed in DSWB. Find a slot between March - May for 2-3 days.
  * We don't want to write from the scratch, if some of our partners have these chapters we highlight those - chapters are supposed to be small and digestible
  * We would have pre-event sessions so interested participants can be taught what they need to actively participate in the book dash.
  * We already have style templates that can be followed, so we would be using that: https://deploy-preview-4043--the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/contributing.html 

### Breakout room discussion notes

* Review the curated 'pathway' for Data Science Without Borders community -- how to use and share this in your network: https://deploy-preview-4043--the-turing-way.netlify.app/data-science-without-borders
  * Share feedback, thoughts and comments for improvements
* Please take notes in this document or comment directly on GitHub: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/4043

Thoughts on Curated List:

- It would be helpful for the team as they have few data scientist.
- People who are new to DSWB -- will be great test users for this resource (+1)
- Please join tomorrow to work with Precious to comment on GitHub

**Open Q&A**

-
- 

**AOB**

* Suggestion to have PhD & Master students currently being onboarded have GitHub trainings, and be a part of workgroups.
  * Introduce them to the curated chapters, and have them know who to reach out to if they need help.
* Practice with datasets in the Turing Way with the various pathfinders, have everyone participate and then share publicly on social media.
  * A fork can be created from the Turing Way, with DSWB members added so they can work on it.
