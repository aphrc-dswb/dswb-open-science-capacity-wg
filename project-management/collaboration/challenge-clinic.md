# Challenge Clinic Template

This template outlines the "Challenge Clinic" format for Working Group meetings.

A challenge clinic format has been designed to help individuals and their teams address specific problems or difficulties they are currently facing in their work or projects.
It provides a dedicated time and format for colleagues/DSWB peers to offer insights, feedback, and potential solutions to the person or team presenting the challenge.

## Format Detail

A few days prior to each meeting, DSWB members will receive an email requesting to propose specific challenges they are currently facing.
We encourage members to bring forward a wide range of challenges relevant to their work.

At the start of the meeting, all attendees will have the opportunity to indicate their interest in discussing particular challenges by adding "+1" next to up to three issues they wish to prioritise.
It is also possible for an individual to allocate all three of their "+1" votes to a single challenge if it is of significant interest to them.

If there are more challenges than we can get through in a single meeting, we may use the next coworking call or meeting to discuss those.

## Describing your challenge

Please share any critical situation/problem from your project/team that is/was particularly challenging for you to deal with recently. It can be about data sharing, collaboration, project management or any skills/capacity-related issue. You can use the following prompts to think about and add details about your challenge. 

* Name:
  * **What open science and capacity building-related challenge am I currently encountering in my project?** (Clearly describe the specific challenge you are facing.)
  * **What are the indicators that this issue is particularly challenging?** (Explain why this issue is significant and difficult to resolve. What are the signs or symptoms that highlight its complexity?)
  * **Who in my project is involved in addressing it?** (Identify the individuals or roles within your project team who are currently involved in trying to solve this challenge.)
  * **How will solving this issue affect my work/team/community?** (Describe the potential positive impact of successfully resolving this challenge on your individual work, your team's effectiveness, or the broader community you are involved with.)
