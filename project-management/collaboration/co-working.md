# Organising Coworking Calls or Meetings

The concept of coworking is generally associated with the practice of sharing physical office space with different people who work independently such as remote employees or freelancers.

This allows people - who may otherwise feel isolated while working alone at home - to use traditional office setups, create a work routine, and build a sense of companionship with others who they share their office spaces with.

## Purpose of our coworking calls

- If you work from home, you would like to see your colleagues and stay connected with them through designated coworking schedules.
- If you are working with a distributed group of people on a common project, and if communication and exchange related to the project while working asynchronously is an issue, you can get a lot of your work done over a coworking call.
- If you are working on multiple projects and struggle to focus on one task at a time, coworking can help you put aside a few hours of your time to work with your colleagues who you share the project with.
- If there is a task you are struggling to complete, you can invite support from your trusted colleagues through coworking calls.

## Target audience

Everyone in the DSWB community. 

## Organisers and hosts

Our current organizers and hosts are:

- Malvika Sharan, OSPO Now
- Precious Onyewuchi, OSPO Now
- Miranda Barasa, APHRC
- David Amadi, LSHTM

This number has a potential to increase as more members get involved and volunteer to lead calls. 

## Size of the call

There is no fixed size of call attendance. We have breakout rooms to enable attendees work quietly and with a smaller number of people as per needed during the call. 

# Frequency of these calls

For now, we host our call weekly, and have meetings on Wednesdays, 1pm (WAT). 

## Resources 

- Calendar invites are shared prior to the calls. 
- We make use of Zoom, and Google Meet for calls.
