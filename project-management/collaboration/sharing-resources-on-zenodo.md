# Using Zenodo for sharing your resources and its benefits for researchers

**What is Zenodo?**

Zenodo is an open-access repository created and hosted by CERN.
Zenodo provides an openly available and accessible platform for researchers worldwide to share and preserve their research outputs, including data, software, presentations, reports, images, and more.
It helps enforce open science practices, aiming to make research results publicly available and reusable.
By default, uploads are licensed under Creative Commons licenses, promoting reuse.
Learn more about license in [The Turing Way Licensing chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/licensing).

Key features of Zenodo include:

* There are no charges for the uploader, but please use responsibly and avoid uploading large datasets (although you can upload them too).
* Zenodo provides long-term preservation of deposited resources. Each submission receives a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), making it citable and easily discoverable.
* Zenodo integrates with platforms like GitHub and ORCID, streamlining the research sharing workflow (GitHub integration is described here in [The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/citable/citable-cff)).
* Unlike traditional repositories focused solely on publications or datasets, Zenodo accommodates a wide range of research outputs, including presentations, images or other citable materials.

## Zenodo Community for DSWB

A Zenodo Community is a dedicated space within the Zenodo repository where researchers working on a specific project, within a particular institution, or sharing a common interest can curate and showcase their related research outputs. It acts as a focused collection, making it easier for others interested in that specific area to discover relevant resources.

For the Data Science Without Borders community, we have established a dedicated community page on Zenodo to facilitate the sharing of resources: [dswb-open-science](https://zenodo.org/communities/dswb-open-science).

All Open Science and Capacity Building Working Group resources are already shared for reuse.

We encourage all members to contribute by sharing their relevant documents on Zenodo. Please remember not to share any sensitive information.

## Why share your resources?

Sharing your work openly on Zenodo ensures you receive credit for the diverse outputs you create, allowing others to easily access, use, and benefit from your contributions. You can learn more about the importance of crediting different types of work in The Turing Way's [Linking Research Object](https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/citable/citable-linking) chapter.

### Here's how to share your work:

If you are new to Zenodo, you can get started quickly with their extensive guidance on [help page](https://help.zenodo.org/docs/).

Specifically, follow the instructions for creating an account: [https://help.zenodo.org/docs/get-started/create-an-account/](https://help.zenodo.org/docs/get-started/create-an-account/)

After you have created an account, you can follow this step-by-step guide below, or follow instructions on Zenodo: [https://help.zenodo.org/docs/deposit/create-new-upload/](https://help.zenodo.org/docs/get-started/quickstart/)

Once your document is uploaded, follow these steps to submit it to the "dswb-open-science" community: [https://help.zenodo.org/docs/share/submit-to-community/](https://help.zenodo.org/docs/share/submit-to-community/).

### Step-by-step instructions for uploading to Zenodo and including in the "dswb-open-science" community

**Step 1: Secure Digital Object Identifier**

Navigate to the top right of your page, click '+' (plus) button and click "new upload"

<img width="1253" alt="screenshot of zenodo showing upload option" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/295be546-64bd-4cb4-bb1a-8b874c0d6da3" />

You will see a new page for uploading a file.
Before you upload your file, secure a DOI which can be mentioned in your file.

* You will find the option for "Digital Object Identifier" -> "Do you already have a DOI for this upload?"
* Select "No, I need one" and then click "Get a DOI now".

<img width="864" alt="screenshot of panel showing link for securing DOI" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c6c5473-5d1d-4d53-b674-25430236b92b" />

This will generate a DOI like this "10.5281/zenodo.15230100". 

In our example, we will be uploading a slide deck used for a journal club meeting using this DOI.

Our Zenodo record (https://zenodo.org/records/) will use the last numerical part, which will be available at "https://zenodo.org/records/15230100".

Both the DOI and the link can be added to the original document, such as in the footer of the document.

In our example, this text was added to the first and last slides of the presentation: 
> Slides are shared under CC-BY 4.0 License on Zenodo. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15230100, Find slides on: https://zenodo.org/records/1071523010077730

**Step 2: Download your resource**

Now that you have added a DOI, you can download your resource in a shareable and reusable format, like a text file, Word file or other formats.
Along with the reusable file, you can upload a PDF, which can be previewed by the user before they download your file.

For example, here, we are uploading the PPTX and PDF files of a presentation developed by the OSPO Now team members:
