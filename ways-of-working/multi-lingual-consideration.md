# Language Barrier Consideration and Communication

This page highlights the Language barrier consideraton for our community, and the various approach explored.

## Challenge

Our community is multi-national, with members from Kenya, Senegal, Ethiopia and Cameroon. We have a variety of languages spoken, but the predominant ones are French and English.

Language barrier is a challenge we face in our community, which can sometimes hinder full participation from our community members, however, over the past few months, we have explored
a few methods of reducing the barrier in our community, while promoting inclusivity, and these are some of the options we have explored.

## Possible Solutions

These are a few paths we have explored to solve the challenge of language barriers:

- Use in-app translators during meetings. Live captions on Zoom had been the most effective.
- Translate community wide documents in French, and have two versions of them.
- Have live translators during calls, and enable attendees pick what language they would like to listen to the calls in.


As a growing community, we keep exploring different methods of improving communication, and closing the barrier gap as much as possible.
