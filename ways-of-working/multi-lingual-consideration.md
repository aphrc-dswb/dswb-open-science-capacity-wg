# Language Barrier Consideration and Communication

Our community is multi-national, with members from Kenya, Senegal, Ethiopia and Cameroon. We have a variety of languages spoken, but the predominant ones are French and English.

Language barrier is a challenge we face in our community, which can sometimes hinder full participation from our community members; however, over the past few months, we have explored a few methods of reducing the barrier in our community, while promoting inclusivity, and these are some of the options we have explored.

## Possible Solutions

These are a few paths we have explored to solve the challenge of language barriers:

- Use in-app translators during meetings. Live captions on Zoom had been the most effective.
- Translate community-wide documents in French, and have two versions of them.
- Have live translators during calls, and enable attendees to pick what language they would like to listen to the calls in.

As a growing community, we keep exploring different methods of improving communication and closing the barrier gap as much as possible.
