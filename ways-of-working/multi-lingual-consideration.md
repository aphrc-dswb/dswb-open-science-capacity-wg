# Language Barrier Consideration and Communication

Our community is multi-national, with members from Kenya, Senegal, Ethiopia, and Cameroon. We have a variety of languages spoken, but the predominant ones are French and English. Because DSWB is growing to include open science and research communities across Africa and globally, effective communication is key to collaboration. We recognize that language can be both a bridge and a barrier, and we are committed to ensuring that members—regardless of their first language—can fully participate and contribute.

Currently, a large portion of our members use English (Kenya, Ethiopia, and some parts of Cameroon) or French (Senegal & Cameroon) as a second language. This multilingual nature enriches our discussions but also presents challenges when it comes to sharing knowledge equitably. Some members have expressed difficulty keeping up with technical conversations or written documentation when conducted in only one language.

Language barrier is a challenge we face in our community, which can sometimes hinder full participation from our members. Over the past few months, we have explored several methods to reduce this barrier and promote inclusivity. Below are some of the options we have implemented and continue to improve upon.

## Possible Solutions

These are a few paths we have explored to solve the challenge of language barriers:

- Use in-app translators during meetings. This was the approach we began with, but was not very effective.
- Translate community-wide documents into French from English, maintaining both French and English versions.
- Have live translators during calls, enabling attendees to choose which language they would like to listen in. These have proven to be the most effective.

These approaches are part of DSWB’s broader effort to make open science collaboration accessible across linguistic and cultural contexts. As a growing community, we keep exploring different methods to improve communication and close the barrier gap as much as possible.

## Community Involvement

We also invite community members to help us strengthen these efforts by volunteering as peer translators, reviewing bilingual documents, or suggesting additional accessibility tools. Our goal is to build a culture of mutual understanding where language differences enhance, rather than limit, our collaboration.

As DSWB continues expanding across Africa and beyond, our commitment to multilingual inclusivity remains central to how we work, share knowledge, and build open communities.
