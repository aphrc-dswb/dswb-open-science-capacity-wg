# DSWB Open Science Capacity Building Working Group Meeting 

Working Groups in Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) provide spaces for discussions, collaboration and technical skill building for the DSWB community.

The Open Science and Capacity Building Work Group meetings of DSWB convene and facilitate knowledge sharing around tools, methods and practices in open source/science.
Through presentation, discussion and facilitated collaboration, we support members from Pathfinder Institutions to learn about open science and adapt their ways of working to incorporate responsible and open practices and deploy AI/ML tools for improving health outcomes.

**Who organises the OS-CB WG Meeting?**

These meetings are organised by the members of OSPO Now, a DSWB's technical partner.
The meeting is currently chaired by Malvika Sharan (@msharan) and coordinated by Precious Onyewuchi (@preshh0).

## Duration and Meeting Frequency

The Working Group meetings take place online (via Zoom) every two weeks for one hour.
Currently, these meetings are hosted on **Thursdays, at 16:00 EAT**, alternating with the Data Harmonisation and Platform Working Group meetings.

## Format

Typically, each Working Group meeting has a pre-defined theme and/or agenda that includes aspects like presentations about specific concepts, breakout discussions, and technical talks from partners.
Recently, two new formats, challenge clinics and public-facing webinars, have also been included to make these meetings an active space for discussion and learning.

Since 2025, a **live translator** has been providing live-interpretation service in French (using Zoom feature) for our French-speaking members. 

Notes from all meetings are captured in a **Framapad** (https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg).
Live and shared notetaking allows everyone to follow and contribute to the meeting.

## Who attends these meetings?

Members from across all DSWB partner institutions can join all of the Working Group meetings.

Periodically, we also organise meetings in webinar format, which are open to all interested members in and beyond DSWB.
