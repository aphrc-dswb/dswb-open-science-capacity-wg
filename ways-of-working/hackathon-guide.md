# Hackathon Guide

Hackathons are a core activity of the Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) Project, bringing together researchers, students, and practitioners across its Pathfinder countries to solve pressing data challenges. While the planning process often follows a similar structure—covering logistics, mentorship, and technical infrastructure—the expected outcomes can vary significantly. Some hackathons focus on  skill-building and collaboration, while others are designed to create reusable tools for long-term impact, and to influence research.

This guide brings together structured guidance on how to plan different types of hackathons, alongside materials written by members of the community for your reference. These contributions reflect real experiences from organising and participating in hackathons and are intended to provide practical insights to complement the frameworks outlined here.
