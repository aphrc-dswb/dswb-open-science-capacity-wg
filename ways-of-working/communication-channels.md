# Communication Channels

```{note}
Resources in this document are based on *The Turing Way* chapter on [communication channels](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/communication-channels).
```

In DSWB, we utilise various communication platforms to facilitate effective knowledge sharing and information dissemination within and beyond the DSWB community, which are briefly discussed below.

## Website and LinkedIn

The DSWB website (https://dswb.africa/) serves as the primary source of information.
A [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/data-science-without-borders/) is used for sharing updates and engaging with collaborators and community members synchronously.
To update and share information via these channels, please contact the APHRC team.

## Zenodo Community Page

For the Data Science Without Borders community, we have established a dedicated community page on Zenodo to facilitate the sharing of resources: [dswb-open-science](https://zenodo.org/communities/dswb-open-science).

You can learn more about Zenodo and how to use it in DSWB, please read {ref}`zenodo`.

This DSWB community page on Zenodo is the main platform to archive and preserve project-related outputs, including slide decks, reports, datasets (such as entire GitHub repositories and illustrations), and publications. This platform provides persistent identifiers (DOIs) to maintain stable and citable records, enhancing accessibility and longevity.

To learn more about Zenodo and how to share resources from your work, please refer to [this document](https://github.com/aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/blob/main/ways-of-working/sharing-resources-on-zenodo.md).

## Discord

The DSWB Discord channel is where community members interact and communicate amongst each other. We also have dedicated channels for the different WGs within the community. 

We have a page dedicated to explaining more about how we use Discord. Find out more information [here](https://aphrc-dswb.github.io/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/discord). 

## Different Community Meetings

**Different kinds of meetings** are hosted within DSWB, as [listed here](https://dswb.africa/dswb-events/).

Monthly project-wide meetings offer updates on the project’s progress, achievements, and upcoming events. Presentations by different team representatives provide a digestible format for community members, offering a snapshot of recent developments within DSWB.

{ref}`coworking-calls` allow weekly interactions and provide a space for ongoing discussion and troubleshooting. These meetings facilitate self-organised breakout discussions, troubleshooting within projects of attendees' interests, and quiet coworking.

[Working Group meetings](https://github.com/aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/blob/main/ways-of-working/open-science-capacity-building-working-group.md) serve the purpose of fostering Communities of Practice within the DSWB community around shared interests.

{ref}`journal-club` and periodic {ref}`challenge-clinic` as part of the Open Science and Capacity Building Working Group are hosted to engage the community on recent publications and discuss challenges openly.

Additional meetings with suitable formats for specific groups (such as hackathons, Turing Way Book Dash etc.) are hosted by different teams to build cohesiveness and alignment.

Please subscribe to our community calendar to get the schedule of these meetings to your own calendar: https://bit.ly/dswb-community-calendar.
If your event is not listed in the calendar already, please contact the DSWB coordinator from your team, or reach out to Precious (precious@osponow.com).

## _The Turing Way_ Book Chapters

[_The Turing Way_ book chapters](https://book.the-turing-way.org/) themselves serve as a form of asynchronous communication, providing an extensive range of documented data science practices for reuse by others. Community members can refer to and share these chapters at their convenience for skill building, developing an understanding of shared practices, and self-paced learning. These ultimately serve as an important pathway for community members to identify areas where they would like to get involved and build chapters on topics required in DSWB.

Through events like *The Turing Way* Collaboration Café and Book Dash, DSWB members are encouraged to engage with the project beyond their participation in DSWB activities.
