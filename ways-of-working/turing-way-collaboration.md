# The Turing Way Collaboration

Within DSWB, we actively support knowledge-building and the adoption of open science practices by fostering connections with existing open science communities and projects.

*The Turing Way* is a key resource we utilize for learning and implementing best practices in data science.

```{note}
*The Turing Way* is an open science, open collaboration, and community-driven project that collaborates with diverse contributors to develop and share best practices for making data science open, reproducible, and ethical for everyone.

Explore the comprehensive guides on data science practices available in [*The Turing Way* book](https://book.the-turing-way.org/).
```

*The Turing Way* is dedicated to curating and sharing best practices, and identifying areas where DSWB members, in collaboration with other practitioners, can contribute to resource development.

## Using *The Turing Way*

Members from across the DSWB community are encouraged to become active users of *The Turing Way*.

*The Turing Way*'s "Pathways" feature provides user-specific entry points with curated sets of chapters tailored to particular roles and themes. This feature streamlines navigation, enabling users to quickly access content most relevant to their roles and interests.

```{note}
**Chapters Curated for DSWB**

DSWB members from the Open Science and Capacity Building Working Group have curated a set of chapters to guide data science practices and collaboration approaches in DSWB projects.

Please explore these chapters in the [Pathway for DSWB](https://book.the-turing-way.org/pathways/pathways-data-science-without-borders/) to learn about and tech selected set of practices important for different stages of project lifecycle.
```

DSWB members actively collaborate with *The Turing Way* community to curate, read and share relevant data science practices in their networks.  

Through our community activities, we aim to equip DSWB members with familiarity in reproducible, ethical, inclusive, and collaborative data science practices, and promote the wider adoption of these practices within their project teams.

## Contributing to *The Turing Way*

We recognise that *The Turing Way*, while valuable, is not an exhaustive resource. To directly address the DSWB community's specific needs, our members contribute to *The Turing Way* by documenting and openly sharing practices and examples derived from our work.

As a unique community, DSWB possesses significant shared expertise and context-specific examples that are highly relevant to our members and the broader network of health researchers. By contributing to The Turing Way GitHub repositories and participating in community events such as Collaboration Caf√©s and Book Dashes, DSWB community members will contribute to documenting and sharing these best practices, thereby enhancing The Turing Way's utility within our specific contexts.

To participate in *The Turing Way* spaces, please read out their contribution process in the [Community Handbook](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/contributing-guideline).

## Translating Chapters in Different Languages

Translation is a key step for internationalisation of *The Turing Way* resources on data science practices.
While the community work together to make resources on data science practices accessible to a wider, global audience, we recognise the importance of overcoming language barriers to promote the adoption of open science principles and best practices.

One key initiative in this effort is making *The Turing Way* resources available in French, in collaboration with French-speaking members of the community. This collaborative effort involves discussions on internationalisation strategies and hands-on efforts on translating chapters with a goal to make best practice resources accessible to diverse multilingual communities.

To participate in the translation initiatives please read the [Translation chapter in Community Handbook](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/translation) and join the Translation and Localisation Working Group in *The Turing Way*.

### Translation Recommendation 

If you're interested in translating but unsure where to begin, the chapters in the DSWB pathway offer a great starting point. As mentioned above, you can explore them directly here: [Pathway for DSWB on _the Turing Way_](https://book.the-turing-way.org/pathways/data-science-without-borders).


*We encourage all interested community members to get in touch with Malvika and Precious, who will support you in navigating, using, and contributing to *The Turing Way*.*
