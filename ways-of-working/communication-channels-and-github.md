# Communication Channels in DSWB

**Note:** This document is based on *The Turing Way* chapter on their [communication channels](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/communication-channels).

In DSWB, we utilise various communication platforms to facilitate effective knowledge sharing and information dissemination within and beyond the DSWB community, which are briefly discussed below.

## Website and LinkedIn

The DSWB website (https://dswb.africa/) serves as the primary source of information.
A [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/data-science-without-borders/) is used for sharing updates and engaging with collaborators and community members synchronously.
To update and share information via these channels, please contact the APHRC team.

## Community Meetings

**Different kinds of meetings** are hosted within DSWB, as [listed here](https://www.google.com/search?q=./dswb-meetings.md).

Monthly project-wide meetings offer updates on the project’s progress, achievements, and upcoming events. Presentations by different team representatives provide a digestible format for community members, offering a snapshot of recent developments within DSWB.

[Coworking calls](./coworking-calls.md) allow weekly interactions and provide a space for ongoing discussion and troubleshooting. These meetings facilitate self-organised breakout discussions, troubleshooting within projects of attendees' interests, and quiet coworking.

[Working Group meetings](https://github.com/aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/blob/main/ways-of-working/open-science-capacity-building-working-group.md) serve the purpose of fostering Communities of Practice within the DSWB community around shared interests.

Monthly [journal clubs](./journal-club.md) and periodic [challenge clinic](./challenge-clinic.md) as part of the Open Science and Capacity Building Working Group are hosted to engage community on recent publications and discuss challenges openly.

Additional meetings with suitable formats for specific groups (such as hackathons, Turing Way Book Dash etc.) are hosted by different teams to build cohesiveness and alignment.

Please subscribe to our community calendar to add these meetings to your own calendar: https://bit.ly/dswb-community-calendar.
If your event is not listed in the calendar already, please contact the DSWB coordinator from your team, or reach out to Precious.

## Synchronous Communications

A **Discord workspace** has been established and is maintained by the OSPO Now team for the DSWB community. You can use this [joining link](https://discord.com/app/invite-with-guild-onboarding/MngBuwrw) to connect and utilise its features.

This platform offers a lightweight solution for instant messaging and audio calls, facilitating quick exchanges and real-time collaborations among team members. Different channels provide structured spaces where people can ask questions, learn about each other’s work, and get involved with community projects. While it is not the only communication channel used by the community, it is a popular platform, increasingly used for enhancing direct interactions among different teams.

To learn more about Discord and how to use its feature, please refer to this document: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14775688. (Cite it as: Onyewuchi, P. (2025, January 30). Why should we use Discord?. Zenodo. DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14275805.)

A **WhatsApp group** is used for general posts and reminders (maintained by the APHRC team), and the LinkedIn page is used for sharing updates externally, boosting the visibility of our work.

These communication platforms complement our primary communication channels, providing additional avenues (often requiring manual cross-posting) for community engagement and outreach.

## GitHub for Synchronous and Asynchronous Communications

Central to our information storage and sharing, our GitHub repositories serve as the primary hub for project-related documents, community resources, and collaborative outputs from Working Groups, community events, and different kinds of events, offering transparency and collaboration for both synchronous and asynchronous communication.

All Technical Partners and Pathfinder teams use the **[GitHub organisation](https://github.com/aphrc-dswb)** for sharing and maintaining their projects and project management resources.

Established by the OSPO Now team in collaboration with the APHRC team, the GitHub organisation enables the DSWB community to share their work as it develops, rather than only at the end. Open-source GitHub repositories (shared under a permissive license) allow all members to view, refer to, and reproduce resources even when they are not directly involved in the development of the original work. This accelerates problem-solving and the reuse of resources developed within DSWB.

Repositories created under the DSWB GitHub organisation are maintained by the repository owners and managers. All public resources will be shared under a permissive license and follow the DSWB Data Sharing Agreement.

### Using GitHub Issues and Pull Requests

GitHub issues and GitHub discussions serve as a dynamic space where updates, queries, and discussions take place. The GitHub issues and project boards allow the project delivery team to share information related to specific topics, maintaining transparency among community members. These features ensure that even individuals not actively participating in a conversation can stay informed about ongoing developments and contribute where they can. Contributors can respond in real-time, but the system is mainly used to accommodate varying time zones, allowing participants to engage at their convenience.

When soliciting feedback, adding clear titles, mentioning the relevant people, and indicating timelines helps improve engagement. These issues can be cross-posted on other communication channels to boost their visibility.

Some examples of when issues and discussions can be used for communication purposes are the following:

- Inviting community inputs, ideas, and feedback
- Keeping a record of an ongoing project
- Maintaining transparency and access to ongoing work

To indicate the specific nature of the issue/discussion, we also use words such as [TALK], [INVITATION], and [FEEDBACK NEEDED] (in square brackets) before writing the full title.

### GitHub for Project Management

The GitHub project boards offer an excellent tool for defining and managing tasks, such as demonstrated in the DSWB organisation: https://github.com/orgs/aphrc-dswb/projects.

You can learn more about it here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14775653 (cite as: Sharan, M. (2025, January 30). Project Management tips and tools. Zenodo. DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14775653.)

## Zenodo Community Page

For the Data Science Without Borders community, we have established a dedicated community page on Zenodo to facilitate the sharing of resources: [dswb-open-science](https://zenodo.org/communities/dswb-open-science).

This DSWB community page on Zenodo is the main platform to archive and preserve project-related outputs, including slide decks, reports, datasets (such as entire GitHub repositories and illustrations), and publications. This platform provides persistent identifiers (DOIs) to maintain stable and citable records, enhancing accessibility and longevity.

To learn more about Zenodo and how to share resources from your work, please refer to [this document](https://github.com/aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/blob/main/ways-of-working/sharing-resources-on-zenodo.md).

## _The Turing Way_ Book Chapters

[_The Turing Way_ book chapters](https://book.the-turing-way.org/) themselves serve as a form of asynchronous communication, providing an extensive range of documented data science practices for reuse by others. Community members can refer to and share these chapters at their convenience for skill building, developing an understanding of shared practices, and self-paced learning. These ultimately serve as an important pathway for community members to identify areas where they would like to get involved and build chapters on topics required in DSWB.

Through events like *The Turing Way* Collaboration Café and Book Dash, DSWB members are encouraged to engage with the project beyond their participation in DSWB activities.
