# Discord - Synchronous Communications

A **Discord workspace** has been established and is maintained by the OSPO Now team for the DSWB community. You can use this [joining link](https://discord.com/app/invite-with-guild-onboarding/MngBuwrw) to connect and utilise its features.

This platform offers a lightweight solution for instant messaging and audio calls, facilitating quick exchanges and real-time collaborations among team members. Different channels provide structured spaces where people can ask questions, learn about each otherâ€™s work, and get involved with community projects. While it is not the only communication channel used by the community, it is a popular platform, increasingly used for enhancing direct interactions among different teams.

To learn more about Discord and how to use its feature, please refer to this document: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14775688. (Cite it as: Onyewuchi, P. (2025, January 30). Why should we use Discord?. Zenodo. DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14275805.)

A **WhatsApp group** is used for general posts and reminders (maintained by the APHRC team), and the LinkedIn page is used for sharing updates externally, boosting the visibility of our work.

These communication platforms complement our primary communication channels, providing additional avenues (often requiring manual cross-posting) for community engagement and outreach.
