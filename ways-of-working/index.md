# Ways of Working in Data Science Without Borders

Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) is an international initiative, funded by the Wellcome Trust and led by the African Population and Health Research Centre (APHRC).

You can learn more about the project and its resources on our website: [https://dswb.africa/](https://dswb.africa/)

## Primary Objectives

This project has three overarching objectives: 
1. strengthen data systems in Pathfinder countries
2. develop a sustainable environment for collaborative AI/ML platforms
3. create a user-friendly platform for AI and Machine Learning (AI/ML) tools

## Background

The impact of inequality in data availability and access is evident, particularly in resource-limited settings like many African nations. This African institution-led initiative will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to bridge existing gaps in data accessibility, infrastructure, and expertise. It aims to foster a collaborative environment that empowers African nations to harness the full potential of AI/ML for improving health outcomes.

## Pathfinder Institutions and Technical Partners

We would be working with three Pathfinder Institutions:

 - the Armauer Hansen Research Institute (AHRI) in Ethiopia üá™üáπ
 - the Institute for Health Research, Epidemiological Surveillance (IRESSEF) in Senegal üá∏üá≥
 - and the Training and Douala General Hospital (DGH) in Cameroon üá®üá≤

The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the Committee on Data of the International Science Council (CODATA) collaborate as delivery partners, providing support in platform development. The Africa CDC provides key technical oversight for the project, supporting country engagement, identification of priority use cases and provision of guidance for effective policy engagement.

Learn more about the partners on our website under "who we are".

##¬†Working Groups

Working Groups in Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) provide spaces for discussions, collaboration and technical skill building for the DSWB community.

DSWB currently has the following working groups:
- [Open Science Working Group](https://dswb.africa/open-science/)
- [Data Harmonisation and Platform Working Group](https://dswb.africa/platform-development-and-data-harmonization/)
- Students Working Group

You can learn more about each working group on our website under "what we do".

## Contributing to this Handbook

All of the text in this guide is to help DSWB members to engage with each others work and contribute to the development of collaborative tools, practices and methods.
Here, we also connect, centralise and share knowledge with other community-driven resources. An important project is [*The Turing Way*](https://book.the-turing-way.org/), which we collaborate with to ensure that DSWB members can benefit from the best practices documented and maintained in its guides without duplicating them in this handbook.

DSWB members are encouraged to read, share, and contribute their insights to enhance this handbook. Every thoughtful contribution, however large or small, will empower the DSWB community to develop standard practices, fostering an inclusive, collaborative, and supportive culture.

Documentation for the Ways of Working is maintained on our GitHub repository under the DSWB GitHub Organisation, maintained by the Open Science and Capacity Building Working Group: [aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg](https://github.com/aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg).

Please follow the {ref}`contributing guideline<contribute.md>` and {ref}`Code of Conduct<coc-.d>` to start contributing via our GitHub repository.
