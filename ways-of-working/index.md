# Ways of Working in Data Science Without Borders

Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) is an international initiative, funded by the Wellcome Trust and led by the African Population and Health Research Centre (APHRC).

You can learn more about the project and its resources on our website: [https://dswb.africa/](https://dswb.africa/)

## Ways of Working in DSWB

```{note}
Ways of Working is a phrase that describes how people participate, collaborate, and interrelate. 
Also known as working agreements, team arrangements, shared expectations, ground rules and group understandings.
```

In collaboration with our community members, we co-create and standardise our ways of working in DSWB, aiming to engage all community members through inclusive, equitable, and thoughtful approaches.

With a goal to enable inclusive collaboration, good practices in our ways of working will enable our community members to engage in the co-development of the DSWB projects, share and utilise resources effectives and contribute to positive impact.

```{note}
Open science projects use open practices in shaping and delivering on their vision, values, principles, norms, policies, culture and project information required to work openly.
```

In all our working practices we aim to apply open practices to ensure that all members have opportunities and pathways to lead initiatives and receive recognition in line with the project goals.

This handbook provides tools, practices and methods recommended in DSWB.
These resources have been centralised in collaboration with different members of our community, through their contributions to the Open Science and Capacity Building Working Group meetings.

## Project Background

The three main objectives of this project are to: 1) strengthen data systems in Pathfinder countries, 2) develop a sustainable environment for collaborative AI/ML platforms, and 3) create a user-friendly platform for AI and Machine Learning (AI/ML) tools.

The impact of inequality in data availability and access is evident, particularly in resource-limited settings like many African nations. DSWB will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to bridge existing gaps in data accessibility, infrastructure, and expertise. This African institution-led initiative aims to foster a collaborative environment that empowers African nations to harness the full potential of AI/ML for improving health outcomes.

This handbook on ways pf working is for all members contributing to DSWB from across the Pathfinder Countries, Technical Partners and their networks.

### Pathfinder Institutions

We would be working with three Pathfinder Institutions:

 - the Armauer Hansen Research Institute (AHRI) in Ethiopia üá™üáπ
 - the Institute for Health Research, Epidemiological Surveillance (IRESSEF) in Senegal üá∏üá≥
 - and the Training and Douala General Hospital (DGH) in Cameroon üá®üá≤

### Technical Partners

The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the Committee on Data of the International Science Council (CODATA) collaborate as delivery partners, providing support in platform development. The Africa CDC provides key technical oversight for the project, supporting country engagement, identification of priority use cases and provision of guidance for effective policy engagement.

Learn more about our partners on our website under ["who we are"](https://dswb.africa).

## Working Groups Operationalise Ways of Working in DSWB

Working Groups within DSWB provide structured spaces for engagement and collaboration around shared data science interests, fostering Communities of Practice.

DSWB currently hosts the following working groups:

1. Open Science and Capacity Building Working Group
2. Data Harmonisation and Platform Working Group
3. Students Working Group

More information about each working group is available on our website under ["What We Do"](https://dswb.africa).

These Working Groups enable members to communicate their work, exchange ideas, discuss data and AI skills, identify collaboration opportunities, build shared resources, and embed open and collaborative approaches into their work.

Working Groups are key channels through which DSWB's ways of working are disseminated and operationalised.

## Contributing to this Handbook

All of the text in this guide is to help DSWB members engage with each other's work and contribute to the development of collaborative tools, practices and methods.
We also connect, centralise and share knowledge from other community-driven resources.

DSWB members are encouraged to read, share, and contribute their insights to enhance this handbook. Every thoughtful contribution, however large or small, will empower the DSWB community to develop standard practices, fostering an inclusive, collaborative, and supportive culture.

```{note}
An important project is [*The Turing Way*](https://book.the-turing-way.org/), a collaborator in our efforts to provide DSWB members with access to well-documented and maintained best practices, avoiding duplication within this handbook.

DSWB members actively collaborate with *The Turing Way* to curate and share relevant data science practices, which are referenced and recommended in various documents throughout this handbook. Furthermore, to directly address the DSWB community's needs, our members contribute to *The Turing Way* by documenting and openly sharing practices and examples derived from our work.

Documentation for the Ways of Working is developed on our GitHub repository under the DSWB GitHub Organisation, maintained by the Open Science and Capacity Building Working Group: [aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg](https://github.com/aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg).

Please read {ref}`contributing guideline<contribute>` and {ref}`Code of Conduct<coc>` to start contributing via our GitHub repository.

Please follow the style guide and related processes described in [*The Turing Way* Community Handbook](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/style) to contribute to, maintain and improve resources within this book.
