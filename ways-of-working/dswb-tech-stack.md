# Tools and Tech Stack

In DSWB, we used the following tech stack to meet the needs of our community and facilitate collaboration. 

## Communication Channels

- Website: https://dswb.africa/
- Emails:
  - All DSWB Consortium delegates: DSWBcdelegates@aphrc.org
  - Agnes Kirraga - Project Lead: akiragga@aphrc.org
  - Miranda Barasa - DSWB Program Manager: mbarasa@aphrc.org
- Discord: [Join using this link](https://discord.gg/UY8cHBEKMr)
- WhatsApp group: Please request Miranda to add you
- LinkedIn: Please send your post request to promote a DSWB-related event/project/activity with an appropriate blurb to Miranda.

## Meeting Tools

- Zoom: Meetings hosted via APHRC/DSWB dedicated Zoom links - please request Miranda if you need to use Zoom for your DSWB-related meetings.
- Google calendar: Add your event in the [community calendar](https://bit.ly/dswb-community-calendar) - if you don't have edit access, please contact Precious Onyewuchi from the OSPO Now team.
- Framapad: The OSPO Now team uses Framapad for live note-taking during meetings (example from a [Working Group Meeting shared note](https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg)), which are later archived in GitHub.
- Cuckoo Clock: For a shared clock (such as to start a timer for breakout discussion or a synchronous activity), you can use the Cuckoo clock: https://cuckoo.team/.

## Resource Sharing

- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Jpkl7EdgH5brpXIgmg6Fdtn7Jlf-OTx0?usp=sharing) - shared with DSWB members.
  - All DSWB delegates should have access to read and create resources such as in Google Docs, Sheets and Slides.
  - Information that can be reused, such as reports, templates, documentation, resources etc., that doesn't hold sensitive information can be published on Zenodo. Any record-keeping that should be available for the community should be centralised on GitHub for reference by the community.
- [GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/aphrc-dswb) - Please request the DSWB coordinator from your team to add you.
- [Zenodo `dswb-open-science`](https://zenodo.org/communities/dswb-open-science/) - [follow instructions](./sharing-resources-on-zenodo.md) to submit your resource.
  - Any materials developed on GitHub and Google Drive for reuse by others should be published here
