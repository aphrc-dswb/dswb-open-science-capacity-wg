# Tools and Tech Stack

In DSWB, we use the following tech stack to meet the needs of our community and facilitate collaboration. 

## Communication Channels

- **Website**: https://dswb.africa/
- **Emails**:
  - All DSWB Consortium delegates: DSWBcdelegates@aphrc.org
  - Agnes Kirraga - Project Lead: akiragga@aphrc.org
  - Miranda Barasa - DSWB Program Manager: mbarasa@aphrc.org
- **Discord**: [Join using this link](https://discord.gg/UY8cHBEKMr)
- **WhatsApp group**: Please request Miranda to add you
- **LinkedIn**: Browse recent [posts on LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/data-science-without-borders/). Please send your post request to promote a DSWB-related event/project/activity with an appropriate blurb to Miranda.

## Meeting Tools

- **Zoom**: Meetings hosted via APHRC/DSWB dedicated Zoom links - please request Miranda if you need to use Zoom for your DSWB-related meetings.
- **Google Calendar**: Add your event in the [community calendar](https://bit.ly/dswb-community-calendar) - if you don't have edit access, please contact Precious Onyewuchi from the OSPO Now team.
- **Framapad**: The OSPO Now team uses Framapad for live note-taking during meetings (example from a [Working Group Meeting shared note](https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg)), which are later archived in GitHub.
- **Cuckoo Clock**: For a shared clock (such as to start a timer for breakout discussion or a synchronous activity), you can use the Cuckoo clock: https://cuckoo.team/.

## Resource Co-Development and Sharing

- **Collaborate with others and co-develop resources in DSWB**: Please use [**GitHub Organisation**](https://github.com/aphrc-dswb) to create project repositories and project boards. Learn more about {ref}`how to use GitHub<github`>

## Resource Sharing

- **Informtion and resources for public access and reuse**: Share these on [**Zenodo `dswb-open-science` page**](https://zenodo.org/communities/dswb-open-science/) - [follow instructions](./sharing-resources-on-zenodo.md) to submit your resource. Learn more about {ref}`how to use Zenodo<zenodo>`
- **Information and resources that are limited for access by DSWB members**: These can be shared and stored in [**Google Drive**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Jpkl7EdgH5brpXIgmg6Fdtn7Jlf-OTx0?usp=sharing).
- **Sensitive data**: Please consult your institutions policy and seek guidance from your institution representative for guidance on where sensitive information can be locally stored and who has the authority to access them. DO NOT SHARE THEM VIA ANY OF THE LISTED PLATFORMS.

## General Recommendations

- Please adhere to the DSWB Data Sharing Agreement to guide your data management and sharing processes.
- Develop a data management plan tailored to your project's needs, utilizing the guidance provided in the [Research Data Management chapters in *The Turing Way*](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm).
- Maximise the use of GitHub for collaborative development and sharing of tools and resources within DSWB. Non-research resources, such as reports, templates, and record-keeping documents for the DSWB community, should be centralized on GitHub for easy reference.
- To enable proper citation, share different versions of resources developed on GitHub via Zenodo to obtain a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).
- Move any reusable materials currently in Google Drive (excluding sensitive data and information) to GitHub and subsequently publish them on Zenodo.
- Project management resources maintained by APHRC are frequently shared via the DSWB Google Drive. All DSWB delegates should have read and write access to resources within Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Community-related information unsuitable for public sharing can be stored in Google Drive by other teams, with access restricted to DSWB members.
- Publish reusable information, including reports, templates, documentation, and other resources that do not contain sensitive information, on Zenodo.
