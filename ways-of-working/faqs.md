<summary><b> Where can Pathfinder members add information on GitHub? </b></summary>
<br>
Each Pathfinder organisation has a GitHub repository created to upload their work to. This can be in the form of meeting reports, OMOP standards, anonymised data, or any other important information that should be public.

<br> 
<strong> Note: </strong> It is important that the information uploaded on GitHub is not sensitive data. Kindly confirm with your Project Coordinator what is considered sensitive if you're unsure.
