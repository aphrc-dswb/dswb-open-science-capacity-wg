# Hackathon Planning Checklist

Planning a hackathon requires a lot of moving pieces and ensuring that relevant processes are put in order.

This is a checklist for organizing hackathons to enable organizers to be on track. It results from community-wide discussions, some of which are captured in a previous issue, [here](https://github.com/aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/issues/23).

### Before the Hackathon
- [ ] Define hackathon objectives and themes
  - [ ] Set research questions
  - [ ] Separate themes by skill levels (PhD, Master's vs short-term hackathon)
  - [ ] Clarify hackathon questions and prospective solutions
  - [ ] Determine if solutions are open source or proprietary
  - [ ] Address legal and ethical considerations of each option
- [ ] Invite technical partners from different groups
  - [ ] Define clear asks and create opportunities for DSWB partners to collaborate
- [ ] Prepare materials and resources
  - [ ] Use the existing template
  - [ ] Review the hackathon organizer's Participant Agreement and Code of Conduct
  - [ ] Identify the information needed from participants during planning
- [ ] Send application call through different channels - comms channels and DSWB LinkedIn for outreach - to improve reach
- [ ] Select participants through applications
- [ ] Create Discord channels for hackathon teams and organizers
- [ ] Share links with participants and set permissions (public/private as needed)
- [ ] Monitor channels to keep participants on track

### During the Hackathon
- [ ] Thank everyone for their work and participation
- [ ] Split participation between online and in-person groups

### After the Hackathon
- [ ] Evaluate outcomes  
  - [ ] Have judges review all documentation
- [ ] Capture outcomes  
  - [ ] Develop potential products and publish the winning idea
  - [ ] Ensure winners are communicated to regarding when to expect their prizes, and are appropriately awarded them
  - [ ] Ensure participants who didn’t win still gain experience and learning  
  - [ ] Gather feedback from leadership on the winning project and follow recommendations for support - if promised
  - [ ] Define clear asks and create opportunities for DSWB partners to collaborate  
  - [ ] Compile a full report 
  - [ ] Document what worked well for future hackathons  
  - [ ] Document what needs improvement and plan changes for future events
