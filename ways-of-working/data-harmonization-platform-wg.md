# Data Harmonization and Platform Working Group

The Data Harmonization and Platform (DH-P) Work Group meetings of DSWB convene and facilitate knowledge sharing around methods, standards, and tools for harmonizing diverse health data. Through presentations, discussions, and collaborative support, we help members from Pathfinder Institutions learn how to transform and map data into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM), enabling consistent, reproducible analysis and cross-site collaboration for improved health outcomes.

This work involves acquiring, cleaning, mapping, transforming, integrating, and validating data to ensure consistency, enable collaboration, support large-scale analysis, and maintain reproducibility. The group also supports vocabulary standardization, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and the analysis of harmonized datasets.

**Who organises the DH-P WG Meeting?**

These meetings are organised by the members of APHRC team, and other technical partners.
The meeting is currently chaired by Steve Cygu, Pauline Ondeso and Miranda Barasa.

## Duration and Meeting Frequency

The Working Group meetings take place online (via Zoom) every two weeks for one hour.
Currently, these meetings are hosted on **Thursdays, at 16:00 EAT**, alternating with the Open Science and Capacity Building Working Group meetings.

## Format

Typically, each Working Group meeting has a pre-defined theme and/or agenda that includes aspects like presentations about specific concepts, breakout discussions, and technical talks from partners.

Since 2025, a **live translator** has been providing live-interpretation service in French (using Zoom feature) for our French-speaking members.
