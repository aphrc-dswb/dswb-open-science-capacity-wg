This document describes how to structure hackathons to address challenges in retrospective record linkage (RL) using advanced AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Synthetic datasets are used to preserve privacy while maintaining real-world complexity, enabling participants to design scalable and secure solutions for global health and research.  

## Purpose and Context  
Record linkage connects records across datasets where unique identifiers are unavailable. This process is essential for population health monitoring, policy analysis, and research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Real-world data is often noisy, incomplete, and inconsistently formatted, making accurate RL difficult. The hackathon provides a framework for testing AI/ML methods against these challenges.  

## Goals  
- Develop accurate, scalable, and efficient RL models.  
- Ensure solutions are generalizable across domains.  
- Optimize for low-resource environments.  
- Produce reproducible, well-documented, and open-source outputs.  

## Participants 

Potential participants can be: 
- Early-career researchers and graduate students.  
- Machine learning engineers and data scientists.  
- Industry professionals in healthtech and data integration.  

**Team size:** 3â€“5 participants with diverse skills.  


## Format and Deliverables  
- **Duration:** 30 days or more, depending on agreed plans
- **Mode:** Hybrid (virtual + physical hubs)  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Functional RL model with reproducible code  
  - Technical report on methods and results  
  - 15-minute demo or pitch video  

## Support and Workflow  
Participants receive:  
- Onboarding materials and technical guides  
- Pre-event workshops on RL and synthetic data  
- Cloud computing credits (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
- GitHub repositories and collaboration tools (Slack, Zoom)  

Mentorship covers data quality, ML modeling, domain insights, and deployment.  

## Evaluation and Recognition  
**Criteria:**  
- Accuracy: 50%  
- Reusability: 30%  
- Innovation: 10%  
- Efficiency: 10%  

**Awards:**  
- Best Overall Solution  
- Most Reusable Solution  
- Most Innovative Approach  
- Top Novice Hackers  

**Special mentions:** Best Visualization, Cleanest Code, Most Improved Team.  

## After the Event  
- Open-source repository of all outputs  
- Technical report and webinar series  
- Feedback collection from participants and partners  
- Impact tracked through repository engagement, collaborations, and citations  

## Future Roadmap  
- Annual hackathon series with rotating locations  
- Technical workshops on advanced RL methods  
- Joint publications to share innovations  
- Long-term goal: build an inclusive and sustainable framework for AI-driven record linkage in global health research.
