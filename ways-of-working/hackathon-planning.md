# Organising an AI-Based Hackathon on Retrospective Record Linkage
**Author: Tathagata Bhattacharjee**
**Organised by: LSHTM | Data Science Without Borders (DSWB)**  

This document describes how to structure hackathons to address challenges in retrospective record linkage (RL) using advanced AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Synthetic datasets are used to preserve privacy while maintaining real-world complexity, enabling participants to design scalable and secure solutions for global health and research.  

## Purpose and Context  
Record linkage connects records across datasets where unique identifiers are unavailable. This process is essential for population health monitoring, policy analysis, and research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Real-world data is often noisy, incomplete, and inconsistently formatted, making accurate RL difficult. The hackathon provides a framework for testing AI/ML methods against these challenges.  

## Goals  
- Develop accurate, scalable, and efficient RL models.  
- Ensure solutions are generalizable across domains.  
- Optimize for low-resource environments.  
- Produce reproducible, well-documented, and open-source outputs.  

## Participants 

Potential participants can be: 
- Early-career researchers and graduate students.  
- Machine learning engineers and data scientists.  
- Industry professionals in healthtech and data integration.  

**Team size:** 3â€“5 participants with diverse skills.  


## Format and Deliverables  
- **Duration:** 30 days or more, depending on agreed plans
- **Mode:** Hybrid (virtual + physical hubs)  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Functional RL model with reproducible code  
  - Technical report on methods and results  
  - 15-minute demo or pitch video  

## Support and Workflow  

Participants will receive onboarding materials, technical guides, and access to workshops on RL and synthetic data. Cloud computing resources, GitHub repositories, and collaboration tools will be provided. Mentors with expertise in data quality, ML, domain interpretation, and software deployment will support participants through office hours and dedicated channels.

Mentorship covers data quality, ML modeling, domain insights, and deployment.  

## Evaluation and Recognition  
**Criteria:**  
- Accuracy: 50%  
- Reusability: 30%  
- Innovation: 10%  
- Efficiency: 10%  

**Awards:**  
- Best Overall Solution  
- Most Reusable Solution  
- Most Innovative Approach  
- Top Novice Hackers  

Special recognition can be given for Best Visualization, Cleanest Code, and Most Improved Team.


## After the Event  
 Outputs will be published in an open repository, with a technical report and webinar series showcasing top teams. Feedback will inform future events. Impact will be tracked through repository engagement, collaborations, and citations. For example, the number of GitHub repositories forked or starred after the hackathon will be one of the primary metrics used to gauge its impact. 

## Future Roadmap  

The organisers can plan to establish an annual hackathon series with rotating locations, expand technical workshops on advanced RL, and encourage joint publications. The long-term goal is to build an inclusive, sustainable framework for AI-driven record linkage in global health research.
