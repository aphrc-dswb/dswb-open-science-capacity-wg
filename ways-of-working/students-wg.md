# Students Working Group

Working Groups in Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) provide spaces for discussions, collaboration and technical skill building for the DSWB community.

The DSWB students WG involves the coordination and sharing of information, expertise, and opportunities amongst the MSc and PhD students 
that are part of the DSWB project. The students engage each other by sharing ideas, challenges, tools, methodologies and progress on their research projects. 
Trainings are also held for capacity building and the WG is dedicated to building and equipping its members 
with the adequate skillset and network for the next generation of data scientists. 

**Who organises the Students WG Meeting?**

These meetings are organised by the members of the Student WG.
The Working Group is currently chaired and coordinated by Anicet Onana and Miranda Barasa.

## Duration and Meeting Frequency

The Working Group meetings take place online (via Zoom) once a month for an hour **at 15:00 EAT** on the first Tuesday.

## Format

Typically, each Working Group meeting has a pre-defined theme and/or agenda that includes aspects like presentations about specific concepts, 
breakout discussions, and an active space for discussion and learning to enable challenges to be shared and solutions found.

A **live translator** provides live-interpretation service in French (using Zoom feature) for our French-speaking members. 

## Who attends these meetings?

Students, their Supervisors and the Project Coordinators from the different DSWB partner institutions.

Periodically, we also organise meetings in webinar format, which are open to all interested members in and beyond DSWB.

If you have any questions, or need any help please ask Precious Onyewuchi, Dr Anicet Onana or Miranda Barasa.
