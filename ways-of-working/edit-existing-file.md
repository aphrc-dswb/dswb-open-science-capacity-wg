# Editing an Existing File on GitHub

> **This chapter introduces the process for editing an existing file directly in our Ways of Working document.**

## Navigating and Editing a File on our Ways of Working

To begin editing:

1. Go to our [Ways of Working website](https://aphrc-dswb.github.io/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/).
2. Open the specific page you wish to modify.
3. Click on the pencil icon (✏️) to open the GitHub web editor.
4. Create a fork of the project if you have not yet; you will be prompted to.
5. On the chosen page, click on the GitHub edit icon. It is also a pencil (✏️) icon. 
6. Make your changes in the specific file and preview them.
7. Once edits are complete, click the **“Commit changes...”** button on the top right-hand corner of your screen. 
8. Provide a short but clear commit message and a longer description if necessary.
9. Choose the option to **create a new branch for your changes**.
10. After committing, GitHub will prompt you to **open a Pull Request (PR)**.
11. Title the PR as `[WIP] Edit filename.md` to indicate it’s a Work In Progress.

The next step is to have your changes reviewed and merged - if accepted.

## Requesting Review and Merging

1. Request a review by tagging a reviewer (e.g., `@Precious`).
2. Address any review comments and push follow-up commits to the same branch.
3. Once ready, change the PR title to `[Ready for review] Edit filename.md`.
4. After approval, your PR would be merged into the main branch.
5. The changes will now be live in the GitHub repository and reflected wherever the content is published.
