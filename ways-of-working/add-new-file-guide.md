# Adding a New File on GitHub

> **This chapter introduces the process for creating and adding a new file directly to our Ways of Working document. It covers navigating to the correct location, creating the file, committing changes, and opening a Pull Request (PR) for review. You will also learn how to request a review and get your new file merged into the project.**

## Navigating and Adding a New File on our Ways of Working

To add a new file:  

1. Go to our [Ways of Working website](https://aphrc-dswb.github.io/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/).  
2. Identify where in the documentation structure your new file should be created.  
3. Open the [Ways of Working folder](https://github.com/aphrc-dswb/dswb-open-science-capacity-wg/tree/main/ways-of-working) in the DSWB GitHub repository.  
4. Click the **“+”** icon on the top left.  
5. Name your file clearly (e.g., `filename.md`) following our naming conventions.  
8. Add your content in the GitHub editor. You may use chapter templates to maintain consistency.  
9. Click the **Commit changes...** button on the top right.
10. Provide a short but clear commit message and a longer description if necessary.  
11. Choose the option to **create a new branch for your commit**.  
12. Commit the file.  
13. GitHub will prompt you to **open a Pull Request (PR)**.  
14. Title the PR as `[WIP] Add filename.md` to indicate it’s a Work In Progress.  

The next step is to have your new file reviewed and merged - if accepted.  

## Requesting Review and Merging

1. Request a review by tagging a reviewer (e.g., `@Preshh0`).  
2. Address any review comments and push follow-up commits to the same branch.  
3. Once ready, change the PR title to `[Ready for review] Add filename.md`.  
4. After approval, your PR will be merged into the main branch.  
5. The new file will now be live in the GitHub repository and reflected on the Ways of Working document.
