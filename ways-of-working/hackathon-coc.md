# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.  
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

---

## Our Standards

### Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience  
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community  

### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of offensive language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission  
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.  

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.  

---

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, part of which are:

### Communication Channels
Please be respectful when communicating through these channels. Messages should mostly be in the general channels, and only send DMs when needed. If/when you send a message, whether publicly or privately, kindly practice patience as not everyone is in the same timezone or has the same availability as you.  

### Events
Be respectful and mindful of each other, and apply the guidelines stated in this document.  

During hackathons especially, when attending or participating in events we host, we hope that you are able to have fun and enjoy them. No one is expected to work long hours, and everyone is expected to take regular breaks, have meals, and sleep!  

We would like you to experience these events at your best. Also, you do your best work when rested!  

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.  

---

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to **{name and email address}**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.  

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.  

---

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these **Community Impact Guidelines** in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
- **Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.  
- **Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.  

### 2. Warning
- **Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.  
- **Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.  

### 3. Temporary Break
- **Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour.  
- **Consequence:** A temporary break from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.  

### 4. Other Measures
- **Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of disrespect for the community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.  
- **Consequence:** Other more serious measures may be taken in consultation with the community leaders.
