# Zenodo for Sharing Output

Zenodo is an open-access repository created and hosted by CERN.
Zenodo provides an openly available and accessible platform for researchers worldwide to share and preserve their research outputs, including data, software, presentations, reports, images, and more.
It helps enforce open science practices, aiming to make research results publicly available and reusable.
By default, uploads are licensed under Creative Commons licenses, promoting reuse.
Researchers can also choose other licenses suitable for the specific type of their research outputs.

Key features of Zenodo include:

* There are no charges for the uploader, but please use responsibly and avoid uploading large datasets (although you can upload them too).
* Zenodo provides long-term preservation of deposited resources. Each submission receives a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), making it citable and easily discoverable. Learn more about DOIs [here](https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/citable/citable-steps#cm-citable-steps-doi).
* Zenodo integrates with platforms like GitHub and [ORCID](https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/citable/citable-orcid#cm-citable-orcid-why), streamlining the research sharing workflow (GitHub integration is described here in [_The Turing Way_](https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/citable/citable-cff)).
* Unlike traditional repositories focused solely on publications or datasets, Zenodo accommodates a wide range of research outputs, including presentations, images or other citable materials.

### Benefits of using Zenodo

Researchers benefit significantly from using Zenodo and its community features for several reasons: 

* Sharing your research outputs on platforms like Zenodo can increase their visibility to a wider audience, potentially leading to more citations, collaborations, and impact.
* The assignment of DOIs makes your work easy to cite and discoverable for others, such as through the Zenodo community page.
* Zenodo allows you to get credit not just for publications but also for valuable supporting materials like datasets, software, and presentations, which are crucial for the reproducibility of your research. As championed in _The Turing Way_, recognising these diverse contributions is essential.
* Zenodo ensures the long-term preservation of your research, making it accessible to future researchers and preventing data loss.
* Many funding agencies and institutions mandate open access to research outputs. Zenodo provides a straightforward way to comply with these requirements.
* Sharing data, code, and protocols on Zenodo promotes transparency and facilitates collaboration and the reproducibility of your research findings.
* Zenodo acts as a valuable platform to build a portfolio of your research contributions, allowing metrics such as number of views and downloads, helping you make a case for the impact your work is having on the research community.
* The Zenodo community page facilitates the centralisation and exchange of resources within communities like DSWB. By contributing to the "dswb-open-science" community, you are directly contributing to building a valuable resource hub for the DSWB community.

Zenodo and its community feature provide a powerful and user-friendly infrastructure for DSWB researchers to apply open science principles, enhance the impact of their work, and contribute to the collective resource development.
