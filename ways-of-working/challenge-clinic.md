# Challenge Clinic Template

This template outlines the "Challenge Clinic" format, which will be hosted every few weeks as part of the Open Science and Capacity Building Working Group meetings in Data Science Without Borders.

These Working Group Meetings take place fortnightly on Wednesdays from 13:00 - 14:00 UTC, online, hosted by OSPO Now members.

A challenge clinic format has been designed to help individuals and their teams address specific challenge or difficulties they are currently facing in their work or projects.
It provides a dedicated time and format for colleagues/DSWB peers to offer insights, feedback, and potential solutions to the person or team presenting the challenge.

## Format Detail

A few days prior to each meeting, DSWB members will receive an email requesting to propose specific challenges they are currently facing.
We encourage members to bring forward a wide range of challenges relevant to their work.

At the start of the meeting, all attendees will have the opportunity to indicate their interest in discussing particular challenges by adding "+1" next to up to three issues they wish to prioritise.
It is also possible for an individual to allocate all three of their "+1" votes to a single challenge if it is of significant interest to them.

If there are more challenges than we can get through in a single meeting, we may use the next coworking call or meeting to discuss those.

## Describing your challenge

Please share any critical situation/problem from your project/team that is/was particularly challenging for you to deal with recently. It can be about data sharing, collaboration, project management or any skills/capacity-related issue. You can use the following prompts to think about and add details about your challenge. 

* Name:
  * **What open science and capacity building-related challenge am I currently encountering in my project?** (Clearly describe the specific challenge you are facing.)
  * **What are the indicators that this issue is particularly challenging?** (Explain why this issue is significant and difficult to resolve. What are the signs or symptoms that highlight its complexity?)
  * **Who in my project is involved in addressing it?** (Identify the individuals or roles within your project team who are currently involved in trying to solve this challenge.)
  * **How will solving this issue affect my work/team/community?** (Describe the potential positive impact of successfully resolving this challenge on your individual work, your team's effectiveness, or the broader community you are involved with.)
