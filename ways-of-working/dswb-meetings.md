## Important Considerations

- Information about each meeting is shared via email to all DSWB members.
- Reminders are shared on Discord and sometimes on WhatsApp groups.
- The agenda is shared ahead of the event, and inputs are invited.
- Before the meetings, members responsible for contributing to the meetings are sent details.
- Meetings are hosted on Zoom, links for which are shared via calendar invites. Most meetings are recorded.
- A live interpreter for French and English translation should be invited for meetings attended by all DSWB members (such as for Working Group meetings, project-wide meetings etc.) - seek support from the APHRC team.
- All resources and notes are maintained on a shared Google Drive by the APHRC team.
- A budget has been allocated for annual in-person meetings, as well as for hosting hackathons locally - please check with the DSWB coordinator from your team.
- Reach out to the technical partners for consultation and support ahead of hosting an event, specifically when seeking inputs on format, attendees and data-related aspects (especially for hackathons)
- For planning, hosting or attending events, please refer to the good practices offered by *The Turing Way* [Guide for Collaboration](https://book.the-turing-way.org/collaboration/organising-meetings).
